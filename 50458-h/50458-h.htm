<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>Our knowledge of the toxins is of quite recent
date. It is hardly twenty years since we began to
acquire a knowledge of the facts that are detailed
in this volume, and to which modern medicine owes
its most recent and marvelous progress, particularly
in serotherapy.</p>

<p>In this volume we have studied, besides the true
toxins&mdash;substances of cellular origin and of albuminoid
nature and unknown composition&mdash;other
toxic substances, the nitrogenized alkaloidal bases
introduced into science through the researches of
Selmi, Armand Gautier, and von Behring, and
which are highly hydrogenized nitrogenous crystallizable
principles of definite chemical composition&mdash;the
products of the more or less advanced
breaking down of albuminoids.</p>

<p>Although these principles differ widely, by reason
of their physiological properties as a whole,
from the toxic albuminoids, or true toxins, it
appears proper to consider them as products of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the advanced decomposition of these toxins&mdash;and
in this respect their study becomes imperative, the
more so as they are very frequently encountered
together with the toxins, particularly in serpent-venoms,
where their action is exerted in addition
to that of the true toxins.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this collection we dwelt
on the essentially reducing nature of the cellular
functionation. To this functionation&mdash;causing the
splitting up or decomposition by hydrolysis of
nitrogenized albuminoid foods&mdash;is due the formation
of these toxic basic products within the organism,
whether normally, or because of certain pathological
conditions.</p>

<p>This alone suffices to show that, during physiological
life, oxygen plays an essentially antitoxic
rôle within the organism.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this succinct résumé, which it
has been sought to make as clear as possible, will
be of service to those who, while not scientists
actively engaged in scientific progress, desire to
be abreast of the knowledge of modern evolution,
but yet are not in a position to consult original
papers or large treatises.</p>

<small>ALKALOIDAL TOXINS, PTOMAINES AND
LEUCOMAINES</small>.</h3>


<p class="sub-title"><a id="Alkaloidal_Products"></a>Alkaloidal Products of Cellular Life.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the study of the true
toxins, which are products of an alkaloidal nature
and of unknown composition, it is necessary to
say a few words regarding the most definite of
the toxic alkaloidal principles that are frequently
encountered under various conditions, conjointly
with the true toxins, particularly in venoms, and
which, furthermore, are closely allied to these albuminoid
toxins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>These principles are formed in essentially reducing
media, whether it be within the body of the
organism, and by the simple exercise of its normal
function, in which case the principles bear
the generic name <em>leucomaines</em><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>; or whether due to
the action of anaerobic microbes, when they are
designated as ptomaines.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> These basic principles,
which are essentially the products of cellular secretion,
are usually toxic, and sometimes even extremely
so.</p>

<p>As we shall presently see, ptomaines are essentially
products formed during putrefactive fermentation.
The toxic properties of extracts from the
cadaveric fluids have long been known. Already
in 1838 Panum<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> had met with these products
in snake venoms. Bergmann and Schmiedberg<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> in
1868 isolated from septic pus a toxic substance
which they named <em>sepsin</em>; and almost at the same
time Zuelzer and Sonnenschein<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> reported having
isolated from anatomical preparations an alkaloid
possessing mydriatic properties. It is, however,
due particularly to the researches of Selmi and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Armand Gautier that we are now so well informed
regarding these toxic principles.</p>

<p>The labors of Armand Gautier were first published
in his <cite>Traité de Chimie Appliquée à la Physiologie</cite>;
those of Selmi in the <cite>Actes de l'Académie
de Bologne</cite>.</p>

<p>At first sight, there appears to be a great difference
between these alkaloidal bases, the ptomaines and
leucomaines, and the albuminoid toxins proper.
The toxic bases of the first two groups are quite
definite chemical products which can be generally
obtained quite pure, and frequently in crystalline
form. The toxins proper, on the other
hand, are highly complex albuminoid substances
which greatly resemble the true diastases in all
their properties.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, between the toxic alkaloids,
ptomaines and leucomaines, and the toxic albuminoids,
or more properly toxins, there exists no
absolutely sharp line of demarcation, but there is
a gradual passage from the one to the other by
every intermediary grade, as a result of the breaking
down of the albuminoid molecule.</p>

<p>We shall see, moreover, as we proceed, that
these substances are formed under coexistent circumstances,
and that they are, hence, found together,
whether it be in virus or in snake venom.</p>

<p>We will first consider the ptomaines, and then
the leucomaines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p class="sub-title"><a id="Ptomaines"></a>Ptomaines.</p>

<p>This name is more specially reserved to designate
those alkaloidal substances, generally highly
hydrogenized, that are formed outside the organism,
from the fermentative action of anaerobic microbes
on albuminoid substances.</p>

<p>These bases are generally volatile, with an intense
and tenacious purulent odor; often, however, they
possess a floral odor (aubépine, syringa), and even
like that of musk. They combine readily with
acids and with the chlorides of the heavy metals,
yielding crystallizable salts.</p>

<p>The ptomaines afford no specific reaction whereby
they may be readily identified; and their identification
is effected only after a painstaking analysis.</p>

<p>We must here call attention, however, to several
of their more common properties, beginning with
their basic character, their oxidizability by the air
and consequently their well-defined reducing power&mdash;a
property that led Selmi to propose a mixture
of ferric chloride and potassium ferricyanide as a
reagent for their detection.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> They are precipitated
by all the general reagents for the vegetable alkaloids.
Selmi has given several reactions, such as
those afforded by sulphuric, hydrochloric, and
nitric acids, which appear, however, to apply much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
more to the impurities present than to the bases
themselves.</p>

<p>The <a id="physiological_action"></a>physiological action of these bases varies
greatly; in some the action is an extremely toxic
one, as in the case of neurine and muscarine,
which are true ptomaines; there are others, such
as cadaverine and putrescine, which are quite
innocuous. The physiological action of these bases,
like that of the true toxins, is studied by making
hypodermic injections of solutions of the bases in
healthy animals, such as guinea-pigs, rabbits, and
dogs.</p>

<p>In animals, the principal phenomena observed by
Selmi to follow the injection of the substances are
the following: At first dilatation of the pupil, then
constriction; tetanic convulsions, soon followed by
muscular relaxation, and retardation, rarely acceleration,
of heart-beat; absolute loss of cutaneous sensibility;
loss of muscular contractility; paralysis of
the vasomotors; greatly retarded respiration; stupor,
followed by death with the heart in systole.</p>

<p>It must be observed that in a number of cases
where toxic researches had been made in the past,
these bases had been mistaken for poisons which
were believed to have been introduced into the
organism with criminal intent. No one will ever
know how many have fallen victims in the past to
ignorance regarding the cellular mechanism!</p>

<p>The <a id="extraction"></a>extraction of these bases is a tedious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
difficult operation. The materials must first be
exhausted with water slightly acidulated; then,
after precipitating the albuminoids by boiling and
defecating by adding lead acetate, the liquid is evaporated
to one-half its volume and dialyzed in a
vacuum.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Phosphomolybdate is then added to the dialyzed
liquid, and the precipitate formed, which now contains
all the bases, decomposed by boiling with
lead acetate. After removing the excess of lead,
there is thus obtained a limpid solution of all the
alkaloidal bases in the form of acetates. These
are separated by alcohol and by means of fractional
precipitations with various metallic salts,
depending upon the known properties of the bases.</p>

<p><a id="In_order_to_facilitate"></a>In order to facilitate their study, the ptomaines
have been grouped under two distinct classes, the
one embracing the cadaveric or putrefactive
ptomaines, of undetermined microbial origin, the
other containing the ptomaines formed by microbes
of known character. Each of these two groups is
itself divided into subgroups, as shown in the
following table:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p class="center">GROUP I.</p>

<p class="sub-title">CADAVERIC PTOMAINES OF UNDETERMINED MICROBIAL
ORIGIN.</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> Amines.<br />
<i>b.</i> Guanidines.<br />
<i>c.</i> Oxamines (fatty or aromatic).<br />
<i>d.</i> Amido Acids.<br />
<i>e.</i> Carbopyridic Acids and analogues.<br />
<i>f.</i> Undetermined Ptomaines.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">GROUP II.</p>

<p class="sub-title">PTOMAINES OF KNOWN MICROBIAL ORIGIN.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Ptomaines extracted from microbial cells.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Ptomaines from pathological urines.</p>

<p>We will not here enter upon a detailed study of
the bases belonging to each of these groups. This
subject is a vast one, requiring for its treatment
a volume devoted to it alone. We will here simply
touch upon the principal properties of several of
the bases of each of the subgroups named.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bases of Group I.</span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> <b><a id="Amines"></a>Amines.</b>&mdash;Among these we find nearly all the
fatty amines, such as the methylamines and the
cyclic alkaloids such as pyridine. They are formed
particularly by the putrefaction of fish.</p>

<p>Certain of these bases are very toxic, for in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>stance
trimethylene diamine, the collidines, and
the parvolines.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <b><a id="Guanidines"></a>Guanidines.</b>&mdash;Among the products of ordinary
putrefaction there has been found so far only methylguanidine,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>. This is a highly toxic base
of which 0.2 Gm. is fatal to a guinea-pig.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <b><a id="Oxamines"></a>Oxamines.</b>&mdash;Under this designation the following
bases are comprised: 1. Neurine bases;
2. oxygenized aromatic bases; 3. bases of unknown
constitution. Amongst them we find neurine
and choline, which are toxic, and betaine, which
is innocuous. They are found particularly in
putrid fish.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <b><a id="Amido_Acids"></a>Amido Acids.</b>&mdash;These ptomaines, which are
usually innocuous in small quantities, are particularly
the products of the decomposition of albuminoid
substances. Among them we find glycocoll,
leucine, and tyrosine, as members of this
group.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <b><a id="Carbopyridic"></a>Carbopyridic and Carboquinoleic Acids.</b>&mdash;So
far only one base is known belonging to this
group, and that is morrhuic acid, which is found
in the decomposed livers of codfish, and which
is a powerful appetizer and stimulant in disassimilation.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> <b><a id="Undetermined_Ptomaines"></a>Undetermined Ptomaines.</b>&mdash;Under this heading
are classed certain undetermined bases, such as
those found in normal urines, and in spoiled meats
and bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bases of Group II.</span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> <b><a id="Ptomaines_Isolated_cultures"></a>Ptomaines Isolated from Cultures of Pathogenic
Bacteria.</b>&mdash;Bacterial cultures contain, besides
the true toxins, a certain number of alkaloidal
bases which sometimes possess considerable toxicity.</p>

<p>In the cultures of streptococcus pyogenes there
are found trimethylamine and xanthic bases; in
those of staphylococcus pyogenes aureus are found
xanthic bases and creatinine; while pyocyanine
and pyoxanthine are found in the cultures of
bacillus pyocyaneus, etc.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <b><a id="Ptomaines_Isolated_Urines"></a>Ptomaines Isolated from Pathological Urines.</b>&mdash;Toxic
ptomaine bases have been found in the urines
of a large number of diseases.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It is quite probable
that these bases are the results of a general
pathological condition due to some bacterial disease,
the toxic products of which are eliminated by the
kidneys.</p>

<p>From the urines of epileptics Griffiths<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> isolated
a colorless base crystallizing in prisms having the
formula C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and which was found to be
exceedingly toxic; the same investigator isolated
from the urines of eczematous subjects a ptomaine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
which he named <em>eczemine</em>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and which is also highly
toxic.</p>

<p>In certain cases of cystinuria there are found in
the urine sulphurized ptomaines, and in measles
the urine contains an undetermined ptomaine,
<em>rubedine</em>, which is very poisonous. <em>Typhotoxine</em>, a
very toxic ptomaine, has been isolated from the
urine of typhoid patients; <em>erysipeline</em>, a hardly less
toxic base, exists in the urine of erysipelatic subjects;
while <em>spasmotoxine</em>, <em>tetanotoxine</em>, and <em>tetanine</em>,
exceedingly active alkaloids, are found in the
urines of tetanus patients.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>As a general rule, all abnormal urines contain
toxic bases; the kidneys appear, in fact, to serve
as a means of eliminating the toxic products that
form in large quantity whenever, and for whatever
cause, the organism ceases to functionate normally,
whether it be as a whole, or in any one of
its parts.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>


<p class="sub-title1"><a id="Leucomaines"></a>Leucomaines.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The leucomaines are basic substances, nearly
allied to the ptomaines, but still more closely related
to the ureides. They are formed directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
or indirectly by the breaking down of protoplasmal
albuminoids. The agents that effect the breaking
down are the hydrolyzing ferments of the
economy. It is well to recall here that these
phenomena of hydrolyzation occur within the cell
itself and in a practically reducing medium, as we
have already stated. The inmost mechanism of
these phenomena cannot here be detailed; it will
be found described by Armand Gautier in the
<cite>Chimie Biologique</cite>, and in his work <cite>Chimie de la
Cellule Vivante</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The extraction of these bases is an extremely delicate
operation. It is necessary to operate with a
large quantity of substance, say 50 kilos. The substance
is finely chopped, then exhausted with twice
its weight of water acidulated with acetic acid (0.2
Cc. per liter) and containing a trace of oil of mustard,
which is intended to act as an antiseptic. The albuminoids
are precipitated by boiling, the solution then
filtered, evaporated in a vacuum at 60° C., and the
bases extracted with 95-per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>The alkaloidal bases obtained in this manner are
separated by crystallization from alcohol or by
various other chemical methods, the description of
which we will not enter upon here.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the study of the leuco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>maines
they are classed under three groups, according
to their chemical affinities. These groups are
as follows:</p>

<p>1. <b><a id="Xanthic_Leucomaines"></a>Xanthic Leucomaines.</b>&mdash;The bases of this
group appear to have a composition resembling
that of uric acid. When hydrolyzed, they yield
urea and guanidine. They are weak bases, and
exhibit both basic and weakly acid properties.
They all possess the common characteristic of being
precipitated by copper acetate in acid solution with
heat, and by ammoniacal silver nitrate in the cold.</p>

<p>According to Kossel, these bases are derived
from the nucleo-albumins which are found in
the cell nuclei, and which are, as we know, substances
rich in nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>

<p>Among the bases of this group may be mentioned
<em>adenine</em>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>, which is obtained from
infusions of tea.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> This base is non-toxic; it was
discovered by Kossel,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and it crystallizes easily.</p>

<p>Some others of this group are:</p>

<p><em>Guanine</em>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O, non-toxic, discovered by
Unger; <em>pseudo-xanthine</em>, obtained from muscular
tissues; <em>sarcine</em>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O, also but slightly toxic,
discovered by Scherer; <em>xanthine</em>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
which is found in many urines, and which acts as a
stimulant on the cardiac muscles; <em>paraxanthine</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a toxic base found in certain pathological
urines; <em>caffeine</em> and <em>theobromine</em>, powerful
diuretic bases; and <em>carnine</em>, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, from meat,
a muscular stimulant like caffeine.</p>

<p>2. <b><a id="Creatinic_Leucomaines"></a>Creatinic Leucomaines.</b>&mdash;These have for their
type guanidine; they differ from the xanthic bases
in that they are not precipitated by copper acetate,
but frequently are by ammoniacal silver nitrate.
They yield double salts with the chlorides of zinc
and cadmium. To this group belong <em>glycocyanine</em>,
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and <em>glycocyanidine</em>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O, both very
toxic; <em>creatine</em>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, only slightly toxic;
<em>creatinine</em>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O; <em>lysatine</em>, which very easily
decomposes to form urea; <em>lysatinine</em>, <em>xanthocreatine</em>;
<em>arginine</em>, a vegetable base, etc.</p>

<p>3. <b><a id="Neurinic_Leucomaines"></a>Neurinic Leucomaines.</b>&mdash;These have none of
the characteristics of the preceding bases; their
type is neurine, a highly toxic base found in the
brain, nerves, and certain fish ova. These bases
are sometimes normally produced by the animal
economy, and are also frequently the result of
microbic action. They are the result of the simple
phenomena of fermentative hydrolyzation of protagons
and lecithins. Among these bases are
<em>choline</em>, a weak alkaloid, and <em>betaine</em>, which appears
to be non-toxic.</p>

<p>The former has the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>; it was
discovered by Stocker. Wurtz synthesized it by
combining trimethylamine and glycol-monochlor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>hydrine,
and treating the resulting hydrochloride
with silver oxide. Betaine, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, is found in
beets; it was discovered by Scheibler. Neurine is,
chemically, trimethylvinylammonium hydrate.</p>

<p>4. <b><a id="Undetermined_Leucomaines"></a>Undetermined Leucomaines.</b>&mdash;Among these
bases several are important in more than one
respect. For instance <em>spermine</em>, which is found in
the sperm, is a strong base possessing a powerfully
dynamic and tonic action on the nerves. It acts
as an oxidizer. Spermine was first obtained by
Schreiner<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> from the sperm of mammifers in which
it occurs as a phosphate. It has the formula
C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. It was physiologically studied by Poehl,
Tarchanoff, Weljaminoff, and Joffroy.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> <em>Plasmaine</em>,
a toxic base found in the blood and discovered
by R. Wurtz,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> has the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N<sub>5</sub>; <em>protamine</em>,
from fish milt, was discovered by Micocher.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<small>TOXINS AND ANTITOXINS</small>.</h3>


<p>We have already seen, in the preceding chapter,
that the microbes and the cells of various organisms
are capable of secreting definite products of a
toxic nature to which the names "ptomaines" and
"leucomaines" have been given. Researches,
which were begun scarcely twenty years ago,
have shown that, besides these crystallizable
and definite products, we meet with basic non-crystallizable
substances of unknown composition,
possessing special toxic properties, sometimes even
of extreme violence. These substances have been
named "toxins."</p>

<p>At first this generic name was extended toward
indefinite basic organic products that could be
isolated from tissues and tumors both normal and
abnormal; later on, however, the name was applied
to toxic substances, equally indefinite, isolated
from the culture media of microbes and the active
constituent of various venoms.</p>

<p>It is only since 1885, when Charrin called attention
to them, that investigations began to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
made regarding them. In 1888 Roux and Yersin,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
in their beautiful researches on diphtheria, pointed
out the diastatic nature of the properties of the
active albuminoid matter existing in the cultures
of the specific bacilli of this disease. From
that period, these products began to take a more
and more prominent place, from year to year, in
the study of pathological affections, and, by developing
the knowledge of immunity, they have opened
a new path to the investigations of therapeutic
technic.</p>

<p><a id="It_is_due"></a>It is due to the knowledge of these principles that
we have learned that the infectious microbes, far
from acting as they were believed to do only a few
years ago, and which Pasteur strongly maintained
to be by vital parasitism&mdash;such as would be the
case with the carbonizing bacteria which, according
to Pasteur, act by diverting the oxygen, or causing
capillary embolisms&mdash;owe their pathogenic action
to the toxic substances which are the products
of their secretion, and which spread throughout
the organism, even though the microbe frequently
is localized in a very circumscribed spot, as in
tetanus and in diphtheria.</p>

<p>The idea of intoxication by these products has
now replaced the idea of the direct action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
microbe on the elements or the liquids of the organism.</p>

<p>The occurrence that takes place in diphtheria
and tetanus is one of the best examples to cite in
support of this view.</p>

<p>Here, in fact, the pathogenic microbe is found
only in a very limited area in the organism attacked&mdash;the
false membrane, in the case of diphtheria, or
frequently only a slight wound in the case of
tetanus, and the microbe becomes localized there
only. Now, in both cases, there are general
phenomena of toxic effects. There must hence be
a diffusion of toxic substances which, distributed
by the blood, affect the different systems and
exert a toxic action on the entire organism.</p>

<p>It must be observed that<a id="the_toxins_act"></a> the toxins act as toxic
agents only when in a condition to be introduced
into the circulation subcutaneously. The
cause of this innocuousness of the toxins when
given per os has frequently been studied. It
appears to be quite probable that the cause of
the attenuation of the morbid properties is due
to the intervention of the digestive microbes.
Such is the opinion of Levaditi and Charrin<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>; it
is also the conclusion that is to be drawn from the
experiments of Mme. Metchnikoff and of Cal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>mette<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
on the modifications undergone by a
vegetable toxalbumin, abrin, and by serpent
venoms, when these toxalbumins are inoculated
with the bacillus subtilis chromogenus. Moreover,
Charrin and Lefèvre,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> on the one hand, and
Nencki, Sieber and Somanowsky,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and Carrière,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
on the other hand, have discovered that the digestive
ferments, particularly trypsin, destroy, even
though but little, the toxins secreted by the Loeffler
and Nicolaier bacilli. This is practically contrary
to the opinion of Behring and of Rauson,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> according
to which the innocuousness of the microbial poisons
when administered per os is due exclusively to the
lack of absorption.</p>

<p><b><a id="Nature_of_the_Toxins"></a>Nature of the Toxins.</b>&mdash;The molecules of the toxins
are very nearly like those of the diastases. Like
these, the toxins appear to have a very complex,
and very unstable, internal structure. Their mode
of action frequently depends, as in the case of the
diastases, upon the medium in which they occur.
Again, like the diastases, they are generally destroyed
by the action of sufficiently prolonged heat,
but less easily, for there are certain toxins that
resist a temperature of 100° C. for an indefinite
period. They are, like the diastatic albuminoids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
insoluble in strong alcohol, and are precipitated
from their solutions on the addition of this reagent.
They easily adhere to precipitates that form in
liquids in which they occur in solution, and possess
the remarkable property of diastases in that imponderable
masses produce considerable results.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Although closely allied to certain alkaloidal bases,
the toxins are sharply distinguished by the remarkable
fact that their action is never immediate, but
is always preceded by a period of incubation, which
may be quite long.</p>

<p>Like the alkaloidal bases, they appear to result
from the hydrolyzing breaking down of albuminoids
and nucleo-albumins, and they appear to
be intermediary, from a chemical point of view,
between these bodies, the general characters of
which they retain, and the alkaloids proper, or
ptomaines, to which we have called attention, and
the principal chemical and physiological properties
of which they possess.</p>

<p>No absolutely precise knowledge is had regarding
the chemical nature and constitution of these
remarkable substances. A number of analyses of
these substances have been published which, in
general, permit no definite conclusion to be drawn.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
I have, however, elaborated several speculative
ideas regarding this subject.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>We must here call particular attention to the
ideas of Ehrlich regarding the constitution of the
toxins. According to this scientist, their molecules
contain two functional groups; the one, to which
he has given the name "haptophore," is that
which enables the toxin to attach itself to any
cellular element whatever, and which it then
renders non-toxic by means of the other, or "toxophore,"
group. We will particularize farther on
regarding this very important conception.</p>

<p><b><a id="Origin_of_the_Toxins"></a>Origin of the Toxins.</b>&mdash;These toxic bodies result
either as the products of the secretion of microbial
life, or as the result of the normal functionation of
cellular life in the higher vegetable or animal
organisms.</p>

<p>They are the direct products of life, and do
not result, as was formerly believed, from a more
or less profound modification of the more or less
complex albuminoids that serve as a food for the
various species of microbes, or for the cellular elements.</p>

<p>The vegetable toxins are less numerous than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the animal toxins. They are met with, nevertheless,
in almost all mushrooms which are reputed
or known to be toxic; the seed of the castor plant
contains a very toxic vegetable albuminoid, as is
likewise the case with Abrus precatorius (jequirity-bean),
and certain others.</p>

<p>The true physiological toxins occupy a very
important place in the realization of the conditions
that govern health, sickness, and death.</p>

<p>We will see later on that they are met with in
quite large number in the bladder, whence they
are voided in the urine. Their number varies considerably,
according to diverse influences (waking,
slumber, eating, fasting, fatigue, oxygen, brainwork,
health, disease, etc.). It is necessary here to
observe that the renal system serves for the purification
of the entire organism, and that in the
case of normal life we will find in the renal system
a large portion of the products of the cellular secretion
of the organism, and among the number there
are found, as we know, a certain number of alkaloidal
bases. We will take up later the subject of
urinary toxicity.</p>

<p><b><a id="Autointoxications"></a>Autointoxications.</b>&mdash;The toxins are also encountered,
and often in some number, in the muscular
tissues and in the blood, particularly in those
of batrachians, mureids, and saurians. In the
organism these toxins, developed by the activity
of the various cells, may cause autointoxication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
whenever, for one cause or another, their normal
elimination ceases. "Although there are an
infinity of diseases," remarked Prof. Bouchard,
"there are but a few ways of becoming ill." Of
these ways that of autointoxication is the most
frequent. "What else is it, then," says Prof.
Charrin, "in the last analysis, but to die from
affections of the kidney, the liver, the heart, the
lung, etc., if it be not to succumb because of the
lack of oxygen, the accumulation of carbonic acid,
the influence of the numerous urinary poisons,
the action of acids, of salts, of biliary pigments, or
the effect of noxious principles, which the hepatic
cell must normally destroy or at least attenuate."</p>

<p>These autointoxications, always due to poor
elimination of toxic principles, toxins formed in
very great number in the organism, and which
the normal modes of evacuation or destruction do
not eliminate, are always found to be the cause
of all diseases, even those that are manifested by
attacks of the cerebro-spinal axis, and that exhibit
variously mania, insanity, symptoms of hyperexcitability,
etc.</p>

<p>These autointoxications are controlled by the
nervous system, and the latter alone is the cause
of a larger number of maladies than is generally
believed; in fact, if the mechanism of nutrition be
reduced to its most simple elements, it will be
seen to consist of the penetration of the foods, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the plasmatic principles, to the cells; of their
transformation within the interior of the cells,
and finally the rejection of all the matter that
could not be utilized. It is the nervous system
that commands or dominates this mechanism, that
controls the taking-up of assimilable elements and
the elimination of toxic principles, the fruit of
assimilation or disassimilation, and in such a manner,
in fact, that this same nervous system can,
at its will, cause starvation, or intoxicate.</p>

<p>The marvelous cures obtained by magnetic
methods are due to no other causes than favorable
changes in the nervous system.</p>

<p><b><a id="General_Mode"></a>General Mode of Action.</b>&mdash;The toxins, of whatever
kind, always behave like diastases, in the sense
that their definite action appears to be absolutely
independent of their mass, and that imponderable
quantities suffice to cause serious morbid affections
and profound modifications in nutrition.</p>

<p>Koch has shown that tuberculin is capable of affecting
60 trillion times its weight of the living human
being. According to Vaillard one milligramme of
tetanus toxin will kill a horse weighing 600 kilos.
These two examples show what an enormous power
the toxins possess.</p>

<p>My views regarding the manner in which diastases
act I have developed at length in my work
<cite>Nature des Diastases</cite>. The close analogy between
these substances and the toxins, an analogy upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
which, moreover, I have dwelt at some length, permits
me to refer the reader who is desirous of fuller
details to the small work just mentioned.</p>

<p>The mode of action of diastases resembles singularly
closely that of the catalytic substances,
and we will admit, for the moment, that they
act by intermediary combination, resulting in their
rapid decomposition.</p>

<p><a id="We_owe_to_Ehrlich"></a>We owe to Ehrlich<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> a new conception relative
to the nature and mode of action of the diastases,
and which to-day plays an important rôle in all
our conceptions regarding immunity.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>According to this scientist, the complex molecule
of albuminoid substances is constituted by
a fixed central nucleus, and by a number of lateral
chains or receptors, fixed to this nucleus, which
possess diverse accessory functions, and which
serve, particularly, for the nutrition of the cells.
These receptors have a great affinity for the various
substances necessary for the support of the
living elements, and they seize upon the alimentary
substances, in normal life, just as a leaf of the
<em>Dionæa</em> seizes a fly which serves as its food.</p>

<p>In these special conditions the receptors may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
attach themselves to the complex molecules of
albuminoid substances, such as the different
toxins.</p>

<p>Ehrlich supposes, as we have already seen, that
a toxin contains two special groups&mdash;a <em>toxophore</em>
group, which poisons, and a <em>haptophore</em> group,
which combines with the receptor. According to
this theory, the toxophore group of a toxin can act
on an organism <em>only</em> when the haptophore group
of the toxin encounters a suitable attachment or
receptor.</p>

<p>The receptors attached to the living protoplasmic
molecule attract the toxin, just as a lightning-rod
attracts the lightning.</p>

<p>It is hence clearly proved that the toxigenic
poisons exert their noxious action on the cellular
elements of sensitive organisms, by entering into
combination with these.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that they attach themselves,
in a most rigorously elective manner, to the
tissues, and rapidly disappear from the general
circulation. Numerous facts, clearly established, attest
the reality of this fixation or attachment.</p>

<p>It is thus that von Behring and Wernicke<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
sought to ascertain the quantity of antitoxin (we
will see farther on that this name is given to those
substances which neutralize the activity of toxins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
under certain conditions) which, introduced a certain
time after the introduction of the poison,
will save the life of the animal. They have experimented
with diphtheria toxin, which we will study
later, and they have demonstrated that, if the
antitoxic serum be introduced immediately after
the toxin, a dose of antitoxin twice as large as
that of the toxin suffices to effect a cure.</p>

<p>Eight hours after the administration of the toxin
the dose must be trebled, while after thirty-six hours
it is necessary to have recourse to a quantity of
antitoxin eight times as great. These experiments
show that the curative action of the antitoxin is
so much the less the longer the period of time
that has elapsed between the introduction of the toxin
and the antitoxin. This is because the toxin has
become so intimately attached to the tissues that
the antitoxin introduced has not the power to
destroy the combination. These facts have been
confirmed by Donitz<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and by the classic experiments
of Decroly and Rousse.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>This is not, however, the case with cold-blooded
animals, which, generally, are not affected by injections
of poisonous toxins. Thus Metchnikoff<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
his pupils have been able to show that the toxins
introduced into certain cold-blooded animals
(Oryetes nasicorius) may remain for several months
without alteration in their circulation.</p>

<p>If we consider the facts of the theory of Ehrlich's
lateral chains, which we have mentioned, we are
led to well-defined conclusions regarding the mode
of action of the toxins. In fact, since these toxins
exhibit a pronounced chemical affinity for the tissues,
and while, on the other hand, they can attach
themselves only because of the presence of certain
functional groups of the protoplasmic molecules,
this union can take place only in certain specific
centers. This has been fully confirmed by experiments
<i lang="la">in vitro</i>.</p>

<p>It is known, since the researches of Ehrlich,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
Wassermann and Takaki,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Marie,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Metchnikoff,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
and a host of other scientists, that this fixation is
due to a clearly elective property. It is for this
reason that the tetanus toxin fixes itself only upon
the nervous tissue, and that in this action all passes
as if the nervous tissue had been provided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
functional groups possessing an elective affinity
for the tetanic poison.</p>

<p><b><a id="Means_of_Defense"></a>Means of Defense Possessed by the Organism
against the Action of Toxins.</b>&mdash;We have already seen
that the renal organs serve for the elimination of
the toxins normally produced in the organism by the
simple play of its cellular mechanism. Experience
has shown that the toxins introduced from without
into the circulation are generally finally eliminated,
even though in the meantime the modifications
they have imprinted on the economy may
be transmitted hereditarily; and that their influence
on the general nutrition and the normal functionation
of the entire organism persists even after
their elimination.</p>

<p>Much has been said regarding the elimination of
these toxins by the urine, but the experiments made
by Métin, at the Institut Pasteur, have shown the
inaccuracy of this assumption, and it has been
necessary to seek another.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that oxidation destroys
the toxins <i lang="la">in vitro</i>, and it has been thought that
a process resembling disinfection may well take
place within the tissues of the animal economy,
but no decision has been arrived at regarding the
possible mechanism of this action, which some
attribute to the action of the oxidizing ferments
of the organism, or to the action of certain special
cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>According to Poehl, there is developed as
destroyer a substance possessing energetic oxidizing
properties, which he has isolated and named
<em>spermine</em>, and which is found in most of the organic
fluids and particularly in the leucocytes, the special
rôle of which we will presently study.</p>

<p>There develops still another cause of elimination,
or, to be more exact, of the neutralization of
the toxic principles in defense of the organism
against the toxins, and that is the formation of
<em>antitoxins</em>.</p>

<p>It is well known that the term <em>virus</em> has been
reserved to designate physiological liquids which
were characterized, when first they were known,
by their property of transmitting to an organism
certain functional affections, but the true character
of which is to expend their toxicity upon the
microbes which occur and are reproduced in the
organism, or upon the organized plastidulary granulations,
as in the case of the rabic virus, the special
microbe of which has not as yet been isolated.</p>

<p><a id="Pasteur"></a>Pasteur, when studying rabies, found that the
brain and spinal marrow of rabid animals contained
the pure rabic virus in considerable quantity, and
that every particle of the marrow was capable of
imparting rabies to a perfectly healthy dog. After
having ascertained this fact, he found that he
could <em>attenuate the action of the virus</em>, either by passing
the virus through certain animal organisms, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
as the monkey or rabbit, by gently heating, or even
by allowing it to oxidize and partially dry in the
air, or else by submitting it to the action of antiseptics
or alternating electric currents of very high
tension.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that a deadly virus,
attenuated by one of the means mentioned, may
be injected, without danger of death, into the living
animal; and what is still better, the animal thus
treated acquires the power of resisting large doses
of the virus, less and less attenuated, and that it
is possible to reach a point where the animal
economy may become habituated to very large
doses of a highly virulent virus without the organism
experiencing any visible illness&mdash;that is, the
organism has been <em>vaccinated</em> with regard to the
particular virus.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that this property is
not peculiar to microbial virus alone, but that it
is common to the venoms the toxicity of which is
essentially due to some toxins, with the exception
of those agents noted.</p>

<p>The attenuated <a id="viruses_act"></a>viruses act, as vaccins, through
their soluble constituents, which, either directly, by
modifying the nutrition of certain cells, or indirectly,
by inducing reactions of the nervous centers which
preside over this nutrition, profoundly change the
conditions of life and give rise to the pathological
condition&mdash;the vaccined state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Experiments by Behring and Kitasato<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> have
shown that the tumors of a vaccinated animal,
freed from all organized matter visible under the
microscope by filtration through porcelain, contains
principles capable of directly or indirectly protecting
other animals from the disease caused by the
corresponding virus. Meanwhile, experiments have
shown that the vaccinating matters are totally
eliminated; nevertheless, after their elimination,
the immunity acquired remains with the animal,
which then continues to be protected against the
corresponding virus.</p>

<p>Interest in this subject has incited numerous
researches with a regard to bringing to light the
mechanism of this immunization; and this will
form the subject of another volume of this collection.
We may state here, however, that there
have been recognized two concurrent causes of
this preservative action; the one, called <em>phagocytosis</em>,
results from the fact that the microbe introduced
into the vaccined organism becomes incapable
of producing its usual toxins, while on the other
hand the immunization renders the organism
capable of secreting substances possessing an
activity contrary to that of the virus, in fact true
counter-poisons, comprised under the general name
<em>antitoxins</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p><b><a id="Phagocytosis"></a>Phagocytosis.</b>&mdash;We have seen that an organism
subjected to a toxic invasion tends to protect itself
by proper means of defense; and one of those is
the direct putting into activity of the living cellular
elements themselves, and in particular, the leucocytes,
or white corpuscles, found in more or less
number, according to pathological conditions, in
the blood and lymphatic fluids.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Metchnikoff has shown that the moment a
foreign element, particularly a microbe, enters the
organism, these leucocytes come flocking from
all parts of the body, collect around the bacterial
element, penetrate it, and begin to digest it.
These elements have received the name <em>phagocytes</em>.
The name <em>chemotaxis</em> has been given to the property
by virtue of which they approach (positive
chemotaxis) or move away from (negative chemotaxis)
certain substances which affect them powerfully.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that the leucocytes
are attracted by the products secreted by pathogenic
microbes, or saprophytes. Attracted by
the latter, the white corpuscles surround, envelop,
and finally digest them; and when it happens that
all the pathogenic microbes within an organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
are absorbed, the organism survives, while in the
contrary case it succumbs.</p>

<p>Attention must be called to this attack by the
white corpuscles within the limits where they are
normally confined. It is a pathologic diapedesis&mdash;a
leucocytosis provoked by the irritation of the
tissues&mdash;and caused either by the presence alone
of foreign elements, or by the soluble products
secreted by them.</p>

<p>When, for any reason whatever, this phagocytic
action is impeded, the resistance of the organism
to pathogenic infection ceases to be effective,
and the organism may therefore be invaded by
the microbe. Numerous causes may contribute to
impede this action.</p>


<p class="sub-title1"><a id="The_Antitoxins"></a>The Antitoxins.</p>

<p>We have seen that the second means of defense
possessed by the organism resides in the action of
special products, true defensive secretions, possessing
an activity contrary to that of the toxins,
and which are secreted by the cells of the organism
under the influence of the vaccins.</p>

<p>This is a property common to every organism,
and which is observed even in non-vaccinated
subjects, although in this case the secretion forms
with great difficulty and in small quantity.</p>

<p>When an organism subjected to the toxic action
of a bacterial infection does not succumb to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
intoxication, it emerges from the test gifted with a
new property, which may be augmented by habituation,
and which borders on immunity.</p>

<p>At first we were content to vaccinate small
animals in the laboratory, but in proportion as the
discoveries in this domain extended, and there
developed a need for large quantities of antitoxins,
recourse was had to the larger animals, particularly
horses and cattle. From the moment that large
quantities of blood and antitoxic serum were at
command, search was made for a means of isolating
the antitoxin and determining its properties.</p>

<p>Experiments so far made have shown that the
antitoxins are substances of an albuminoid nature,
of unknown composition, and which are very closely
united to the albuminoid substances of the serum.
It must be observed, however, that Behring and
Knorr oppose the assertion regarding the albuminoid
nature of tetanic antitoxin, but their reasons for
this do not appear to be well founded.</p>

<p>In general, these antitoxins are precipitable with
the globulins, and possess quite considerable powers
of resistance towards physical and chemical agents.
Thus they are destroyed only at a temperature
above 60-65° C. Kept in the dry state, in the
residue of evaporated serum, and away from the
light and all oxidizing action, it is possible to preserve
their activity for a very long time.</p>

<p>They are essentially humoral substances; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
are found in the blood of vaccinated animals, from
which may be obtained antitoxic serums with a
specific but transient immunity; and they are also
found in the plasmas of the lymph and exudates,
in aqueous tumors, and in the milk. They are
seldom found in the cells.</p>

<p><b><a id="Mode_of_Action"></a>Mode of Action.</b>&mdash;Frequent attention has been
paid to the mode of action of the antitoxins upon
the toxins, a phenomenon of great importance in
relation to the phenomenon of immunity acquired
against the toxins. At the beginning of our
knowledge on this subject, the idea of a destruction
of the toxin immediately suggested itself, and was
advanced by von Behring.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> According to this
scientist the antibody inhibits the morbigenic action
of the toxin by neutralizing the toxin, combining
with the latter to form a compound of a chemical
nature which is devoid of toxicity and without
action on the organism. According to this theory,
the influence of the antitoxin on the toxin is direct,
and does not require the intervention of the living
cellular protoplasm. Such was also the belief of
Prof. Ehrlich.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Buchner, a little later, believed that the antitoxin,
instead of acting directly on the toxin,
exercised a direct influence on the living elements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
of the organism, preserving them from intoxication.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Such was also the opinion of Roux<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>; and Calmette
demonstrated that a mixture of venom and
of a non-toxic antivenom recovered its toxicity on
being heated to 68° C, whereby the antivenom
was destroyed (Calmette: <cite>Le Venin des Serpents</cite>,
Paris, 1897, p. 58); and Wassermann arrived at
the same result.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>The array of proofs offered by these scientists,
which we cannot here enlarge upon without uselessly
extending our subject, would tend to make
one believe, at first glance, that the antitoxin does
not act directly on the toxin, but at the present
time Buchner's theory appears untenable. Numerous
researches have proved conclusively that the
toxin and the antitoxin have a specific affinity
for each other, by virtue of which these principles
combine to form a substance free from all toxicity,
but unstable, and which may be decomposed by
heat or certain other factors.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>Some recent experiments by J. Martin and Cherry
(<cite>Proceedings of the Royal Society</cite>, 1898, <span class="smcap">LXIII</span>, p.
423) have clearly brought out this fact. These
authors made mixtures of serpent venom with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
antivenom, which they filtered through a layer of
gelatin, under the supposition that, if the venom
and its antivenom were not chemically combined,
the former alone would be able to pass through
into the filtrate, because its molecules are so much
smaller. Martin and Cherry allowed the venom
and its antivenom to remain in contact for varying
periods before filtering. As the result of a series
of experiments carried out with this idea, they
have demonstrated that the filtrate obtained after
allowing a few minutes' contact between the two
substances, was decidedly toxic, while that obtained
after a contact of half an hour was absolutely non-toxic.
From this the authors conclude that the
antitoxin enters into chemical union with the
venom, but that the combination does not take
place immediately, and requires a certain length
of time for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>Ehrlich and Knorr have demonstrated that the
neutralization is less rapid in dilute solutions than
in concentrated ones.</p>

<p>Prof. Svante Arrhenius has completed our knowledge
regarding the mode of combination between
the toxins and the antitoxins, by demonstrating the
occurrence of limited reactions analogous to the
etherification of an alcohol by an acid, and in
such a manner that there always exists, in a mixture
of these two substances, a certain quantity of
free toxin and antitoxin. This is an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
modification of the general ideas held in this
respect.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>It appears necessary to bring here more clearly
in evidence the fact that <em>the antitoxin inhibits the
noxious action of the toxin, even outside the living
organism, by uniting with it to form a compound
in identically the same manner as when a strong base
and a strong acid are brought together</em>. As we have
seen, all the conditions of environment that favor
or retard the formation of salts, in a like sense
influence the neutralization of the toxin by its
antitoxin.</p>

<p><b><a id="Formation_of_Antitoxins"></a>Formation of Antitoxins.</b>&mdash;Ehrlich's theory of
side chains, to which reference has already been
made, furnishes us with an explanation of the
formation of the antitoxins in tumors. Let us
suppose that, in the organism, a cell had come
into contact only with certain toxic molecules incapable
of compromising its life, and that the only
result was the immobilization of the receptors
which are united with the haptophore groups of
the opposing toxins. It is known that, by virtue
of a property inherent in all living organisms,
during the phenomena of reparation, there is
generally an overproduction of the neoformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
parts. In the case we here speak of, as the receptors
fill an important function in the nutrition of the
opposing cellular elements, once they become united
with the toxic haptophores, they become incapable
of filling their normal function of nutrition. Under
these conditions the cells develop so large a quantity
of receptors that, filling the cells, and not finding
any more room, they spread into the blood and
other liquids of the organism.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, every new injection of toxin
into the organism is absorbed into the blood where
it meets with the free receptors which possess great
avidity for the haptophore group of its molecule,
and the two groups immediately unite, before the
haptophore group of the toxin has been able to
attack and intoxicate a cellular element.</p>

<p>We thus see that the receptors which, when in a
free state in tumors, play the rôle of antitoxics or
antitoxins, become, within the cellular elements
themselves, the vehicle of intoxications. Figuratively
speaking, so long as these fixators are
attached to the molecule of the living protoplasm
they attract the toxin.</p>

<p>According to this ingenious conception, the
formation of antitoxins is hence absolutely independent
of the action of the toxophore elements
on the cellular elements, and it suffices that these
possess receptors or side chains capable of uniting with
the haptophore groups of the toxin. This explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
why it has been possible to produce antitoxins from
toxins which have lost some of their toxic properties,
but which have preserved their property of
uniting with antitoxic substances. Ehrlich gives
the name <em>toxoids</em> to those modified toxins that
have lost their toxophore groups, while the haptophore
group, the producer of the immunizing substance,
is still preserved intact.</p>

<p>According to Metchnikoff's theory, which is
very similar, it seems quite possible that the
phagocytes, thanks to the facility with which they
absorb poisons, occupy an important place as
producers of antitoxins. It has not been possible
so far to verify this theory in our at present imperfect
knowledge regarding this subject. The
domain of immunity has, however, made brilliant
conquests during these last few years, so that we
should not despair of arriving at a definite solution
before long.</p>

<p>In the vaccinated animal the antitoxin is reproduced,
and it is possible to obtain several
times, from the vaccinated animals, successive
portions of antitoxic serum.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The protective power
of these antitoxins is absolutely marvelous. An
animal accustomed gradually to the tetanic virus
yields a serum containing an antitoxin a thousand
times more active than the virus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>
<p>According to Vaillard, a quintillionth of a cubic
centimeter of this antitetanic serum suffices to
preserve one gramme of living mouse from the
effects of a dose of tetanic serum that would otherwise
be surely fatal.</p>

<p>In the animal, the antitoxins are eliminated
mostly by the fluids of the body, and particularly
by the urine. Ehrlich has demonstrated that they
also pass into the milk, and this fact is confirmed
by a large number of observers. It explains the
immunity acquired by nurslings, and which is
transmitted by the milk.</p>

<p><b><a id="Serotherapy"></a>Serotherapy.</b>&mdash;The search for antitoxins and their
rôle in the etiology of infectious diseases are fundamental
points in actual therapy. It has been demonstrated
that the serums of certain vaccinated animals
enjoy very extended antitoxic therapeutic properties;
for instance, the serum of vaccinated rabbits is an
antivenom towards erysipelas; and the sterilized cultures
of the pneumococcus or of the Bacillus pyocyaneus
prevents infection of carbuncle (anthrax).</p>

<p>The antivenomous serum of the ass immunized
by injections of increasing doses of the venom of
the terrible naja is a perfect prophylactic and curative,
not only as regards the venom of this serpent,
but also against that of the crotalus, trigonocephalus,
and viper.</p>

<p>The vegetable toxins possess the characteristic
property of being innocuous, and of being almost
completely devoid of poisonousness, when they are
absorbed by the intestines; we can see, from this,
how greatly they differ from the poisons proper.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>The vegetable toxins known are quite numerous;
nevertheless our knowledge regarding them is very
incomplete. Our review of them will be chiefly
descriptive.</p>

<p>Many of the leguminous plants are poisonous,
either because of emanations exhaled by them, or
by reason of their alkaloids, or because of some
toxins contained in them. We shall commence
with these.</p>

<p><b><a id="Abrin"></a>Abrin.</b>&mdash;This toxin, which was studied in par<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>ticular

Its name was given it by Warden and Waddell, who
discovered both its toxic nature and the vegetable
toxin; the toxin is found only in the seeds. To
extract it, the seeds are macerated in water, and
the solution filtered and precipitated with alcohol;
the precipitate which forms is collected and dissolved
in distilled water, from which it is again precipitated
by adding powdered ammonium sulphate.
The precipitate is then collected and submitted
to dialysis in order to eliminate the ammonium
sulphate. The abrin so obtained forms an albuminoid
substance<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> stable at 100° C., and possessing
rotatory power; it liquefies starch paste, and is
extremely toxic. One milligramme suffices to kill
a rabbit within several hours. It must be observed,
however, that, as is the case with all the toxins,
abrin acts or kills only after a period of incubation
which generally exceeds twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It is possible to vaccinate an organism so as to
withstand a lethal dose of abrin, but it requires
quite a long time; it is effected by injecting into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
a suitable animal very small doses of the substance,
and increasing the quantity gradually. Rabbits
which have been rendered highly immune towards
venoms are capable of resisting without inconvenience
doses of abrin which are ordinarily fatal;
and the blood serum afforded by them contains a
specific antibody for the substance.</p>

<p><b><a id="Ricin"></a>Ricin.</b>&mdash;This vegetable toxalbumin has been
studied particularly by Stillmark,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> by Dixon,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
and Thuson.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> It is found in the seeds of the
castor plant; three or four of the seeds suffice to
cause a gastroenteritis accompanied by serious
symptoms and even by death.</p>

<p>It was first isolated by P. Ehrlich, by treating
the seeds with lukewarm water, and precipitating
the aqueous solution with alcohol. The toxalbumin
is soluble in water, but on boiling the solution, the
substance loses in great measure its activity.</p>

<p>Ricin possesses considerable activity. 0.00003 Gm.
suffice to kill a rabbit when injected hypodermically;
0.2 Gm. are fatal to man. The action is not immediate,
but follows a period of incubation. Ehrlich
has shown that, exercising precaution, it is possible
to create, as with abrin, a condition of tolerance
or habituation, and in consequence to cause the
formation of a specific antibody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p><b><a id="Robin"></a>Robin.</b>&mdash;This toxic albuminoid was obtained
from the bark of an Acacia (Robinia Pseudacacia)
by Power and Cambier,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> by exhausting with water
at a temperature of about 30° C., and precipitating
the infusion with alcohol. The substance is analogous
to ricin, and like this, possesses powerful
toxic properties.</p>

<p><b><a id="Toxicity_of_the_Vegetable"></a>Toxicity of the Vegetable Diastases.</b>&mdash;The diastases,
which have been treated of in a volume of
the Encyclopédie Léauté,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and to which we would
refer the reader who is desirous of more complete
details, develop powerfully energetic toxic properties
when injected into the organism. Thus <em>amylase</em>
causes, when injected subcutaneously, a considerable
rise of temperature, but without any other
toxic symptoms. <em>Invertin</em> or <em>sucrase</em> was studied
by Roussy under the name <em>pyretogenin</em>, but it
appears probable that this diastase was not the
only substance present in the product, but that
there were present reducing diastases, as we have
already shown in the first volume of this collection,
devoted to the phenomena of reduction within the
living organism.</p>

<p>The pyretogenin of Roussy gives rise to an
attack of violent fever, but it loses all activity when
heated to 80-100° C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Through his researches, Roussy clearly demonstrated,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
for the first time, that the fever may
cause the formation within the blood of a substance
clearly belonging to the class of soluble
ferments or zymases. Now, it is well known that
within the animal economy there exist many ferments
of this character; and experiment has shown
that they can, at a given period and under various
influences, leave the cells in which they are normally
localized, pass into the blood plasma, and
reach the nervous centers, where they cause serious
effects. We have already dwelt upon the
mechanism of autointoxication of the organism.
The toxic action of certain digestive diastases has
been shown by Hildebrandt, who has demonstrated
that 0.1 Gm. of pepsin is capable of killing a
rabbit in two or three days.</p>


<p class="center">II. <a id="TOXINS_FROM_MUSHROOMS"></a>TOXINS FROM MUSHROOMS.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are alimentary substances of the
highest order, causing a general stimulation of the
entire organism. The substances met with belong,
according to their composition, to different classes&mdash;celluloses,
sugars, and amylaceous substances, alcohols,
acids, fats, astringents, essential oils, resins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
alkaloids, and albuminoids. The study of the last
only, the albuminoids and diastases, interests us
here. The most important of these albuminoid
substances, <em>phallin</em>, was discovered in 1890 by
Kobert. Pouchet also has isolated a whole series
of other toxic albuminoids, particularly from Amanita
muscaria (Fly Agaric).</p>

<p>There are alimentary as well as toxic species in
every possible variety among mushrooms, some
species consisting chiefly of the edible kind, others
consisting of the poisonous variety.</p>

<p>In consequence of the toxicity of mushrooms,
great attention must be given to the treatment to
which they are subjected when it is desired to
utilize them for alimentary purposes. Thus the
toxic principles of several varieties can be removed,
and the mushrooms rendered edible by very simple
means.</p>

<p>Pouchet has made a very ingenious comparison
between the ethereal, alcoholic, saline, and aqueous
extracts of mushrooms, and bacterial cultures. The
analogy is striking as to the presence of toxin,
toxalbumose, and albumoses more or less toxic;
it is moreover not exaggerated, since, according to
the classification generally admitted, mushrooms
are nothing more than the very advanced representatives
of a group the more simple members of
which constitute the bacteria.</p>

<p>The same author has shown that phallin obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
from the juice of the Fly Agaric will kill a guinea-pig
weighing 600 grammes in one hour.</p>

<p><a id="phalline"></a>As we have already stated, it is the phalline to
which the ordinary disorders which mushrooms
cause are due. According to Kobert, a 1:250 000
solution of this substance causes an intense hemolysis,
with all its disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>According to Pouchet, the flesh of mushrooms
must be compared with meat that has been kept
for some time to become tender, and it is well
known that though this "tendering" process
renders the meat more digestible, it may also allow
the meat to acquire noxious properties, due to the
presence of toxins.</p>

<p>Phallin is the type of those toxic albuminoids
of unknown composition which exist in mushrooms,
and which are comprised under the name
<em>sapotoxins</em>. The intravenous injection of phallin
into an animal, in the proportion of 1 part to
1 000 000 parts of body weight, causes sudden
death within one minute; in the proportion of
1:5 000 000, death occurs in about three minutes;
in the proportion of 1:50 000 000, death also occurs,
but is greatly retarded. An injection of 0.0005 Gm.
per kilo of body weight of animal causes solution
of the blood corpuscles to such an extent that
thirty minutes later the blood serum is strongly
colored red, as well as the veins.</p>

<p>Instead of being easily altered under the influ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>ence
of an elevated temperature, as are many of
the albuminoid substances, whereby their toxic
power is lost, phallin may be boiled for half an
hour with water without undergoing any noticeable
alteration. Pellegrini has observed that the dried
juice of Amanita Phalloides (Death-cup) preserves
its properties for more than a year.</p>

<p>According to a recent paper by Gillot, the symptoms
of poisoning by mushrooms must be ascribed
to albuminoids (phallin and albumose), alkaloids
(muscarine, choline, or betaine), or to resinoids
(cambogic and agaricic acids).</p>

<p>The <em>alkaloids</em> found in mushrooms are: <em>Muscaridine</em>
(an oxyneurine), which possesses considerable
toxicity, and of which 0.00005 Gm. suffices to kill
a frog; <em>neurine</em> (trimethylethylammonium hydroxide);
<em>choline</em> (trimethyloxyethylammonium hydroxide);
<em>mycetomuscarine</em>; <em>anhydromuscarine</em> (an oxyneurine);
and a whole series of various betaines.</p>

<p><b><a id="symptomatology"></a>symptomatology.</b>&mdash;It is quite natural to divide
this symptomatology into three different periods;
that of incubation, that of manifestation of symptoms,
and that of termination.</p>

<p>The duration of the first period, that of incubation,
is exceedingly variable; it very rarely
lasts more than forty-eight hours, and becomes
general only a few hours after absorption. Certain
conditions influence the duration; firstly the quantity
of mushrooms ingested, then the manner in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
which they were prepared; and, to some extent,
the nature of the organism, whether child or adult,
healthy or in poor health.</p>

<p>When it is a question of the more particularly
alkaloid-containing mushrooms, especially when the
poisoning is due to muscarine, the toxic symptoms
generally develop rapidly, the first symptoms
appearing about one hour after the ingestion of the
mushrooms. On the other hand, if the poisoning
is due to one of the albuminoid group, and particularly
in the case of phallin, the period of incubation
is longer, and may last ten, twenty, thirty,
or even forty-eight hours and more.</p>

<p>The symptoms begin with dizziness and an
indefinable sensation of being ill.</p>

<p>The second period is characterized chiefly by
digestive and by nervous derangements. The digestive
derangements are evidenced by very violent
and painful vomiting, and diarrheas of choleraic or
dysenteric character. The nervous derangements
vary according to whether they are developed by
an alkaloid, which causes delirium with hallucination,
or by albuminoids, which cause depression,
ataxo-adynamia, and stupor, these being particularly
characteristic of the action of the toxic albuminoids.</p>

<p>As for the period of termination, it results either
in death or a cure. If the poisoning is due to phallin,
death appears to be an almost inevitable con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>sequence,
as it occurs in 80 per cent. or more of the
cases. The poisoning by the alkaloids is less dangerous,
and the cure, when it does occur, is very
rapid, almost immediate, in fact, while in the case
of the toxic albuminoids the cure is very slow, and
attended by relapses.</p>

<p>One characteristic of these toxalbumins is that
they are apt to develop specific antitoxalbumins.
This fact has been verified not only in the case of
abrin, ricin, robin, and their analogues, but also
in that of the vegetable and animal diastases possessing
toxic properties even in the slightest degree
only. These antibodies generally exhibit their
action <i lang="la">in vitro</i>. Thus antiricin exerts its antiagglutinative
action on the erythrocytes <i lang="la">in vitro</i>
in a saline medium in which the erythrocytes cannot
live.</p>

<p>Here, again, as in the case of the antitoxins, it
must be admitted that the antitoxalbumin possesses
a specific affinity by virtue of which it unites
chemically with the toxalbumin to give rise to a
new substance which is devoid of toxicity.</p>

<p><a id="antidiastase"></a>The first antidiastase obtained by immunization
methods, and according to the mechanism we have
already seen, was <em>antiemulsin</em>, obtained by Hildebrandt.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
This antiemulsin counteracts, both <i lang="la">in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
vivo</i> and <i lang="la">in vitro</i>, the specific action of emulsin.
These studies have been followed by a large number
of scientists, particularly by Camus and Gley,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
Carnot, Mesnil,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and Charron and Levaditi,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> in the
case of trypsin; and Sachs<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> in the case of animal
pepsin. Gessard<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> obtained a very active <em>antityrosinase</em>,
and Mohl an <em>antiurease</em>.</p>

<p>The most important researches regarding this
subject have been published by Morgenroth, Briot,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
and Korschum<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> on <em>antilab</em> (or <em>antirennet</em>). The
researches of these authors have fully demonstrated
that there is considerable difference between the
various rennets, which had heretofore been confounded
under one head; thus there is no difference
whatever between animal rennet and the rennet
extracted by Rosetti<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> from Cynara cardunculus
(cardoon) so far as their coagulant action on milk
is concerned, yet each yields an antibody which
is strictly specific to itself. From a scientific point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of view we see, therefore, that the preparation of
antidiastases permits us to differentiate certain
diastases that could otherwise not be differentiated.</p>


<p class="center">III. <a id="ANIMAL_TOXINS"></a>ANIMAL TOXINS.</p>

<p>As we have shown at the beginning of this chapter,
certain diastases, and particularly those that are
concerned with the digestive processes, pepsin,
trypsin, etc., and which are produced in abundance
by the entire living organism, possess quite clearly
defined toxic properties, and sometimes to even a
considerable extent.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Hemialbumose, from which peptones are formed,
is itself a dangerous toxin. It is generally believed
that the toxic action of the peptones and of the
products of digestion of the albuminoids is due not
to the peptone itself, but to the more advanced
products of digestion, alkaloidal products unquestionably
closely allied to the ptomaines.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the true peptones behave just
like true poisons, when they are introduced hypodermically
into the blood.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Brieger has made us acquainted with a non-proteid
substance, under the name of "peptotoxin,"
which is met with at the beginning of the putre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>faction
of albuminoids. This toxin, which is not a
protein, is nothing else but a ptomaine. It is not
altered by heat, and possesses a very high toxicity.
Brieger claims that it is a hydroxylized derivative
of an aromatic amide.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>Besides these facts, experiment has shown that
the leucocytes, or white corpuscles, the defensive
rôle of which we have noted in phagocytosis, owe
their properties to the ferments which they secrete,
and particularly to some of the digestive ferments.
These white corpuscles are very rich in ferments
of all kinds. Rossbach found in them amylase;
Achalme found lipase, casease, and trypsin; and
the study of immunity has brought to light a
series of other ferments, the alexins or cytases
(microcytase and macrocytase), which have an
exceedingly important rôle to play.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived that under certain
circumstances a part or the whole of these ferments
can pass into the blood of the fluids of the body,
when they give rise to serious disturbances in
certain cases, or confer immunity in others.</p>

<p>It is thus that, according to Gautier, the rise of
temperature which characterizes fever is a consequence
of the abnormal transudation of these
normal ferments into the blood, and their trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>mission
by the general circulation to the nervous
centers.</p>

<p>However, it is not only in the leucocytes that
we meet with these toxic digestive ferments; it
appears quite probable, and has even been partially
demonstrated, that they occur in a large number of
other cellular elements.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to dwell upon the formation
of the antibodies of this group of active substances.
The animal toxins are animal diastases,
and we have seen in the preceding paragraph that
these substances yield specific antibodies with
great facility. For the rest, we will dwell more
fully on these antibodies of the animal toxins in
another volume of this collection, specially devoted
to the study of these substances, and entitled
"<cite>Les Serums Immunisants</cite>," to which we refer
the reader who is desirous of obtaining more
complete details than he can obtain in the present
volume.</p>

<p><b><a id="Alimentary_Intoxications"></a>Alimentary Intoxications.</b>&mdash;What we have
already stated permits us to understand the
phenomena of indigestion and botulism. The toxic
substances form within the digestive tract when
the nervous conditions modify the composition of
the gastric juice, and arrest the flow of hydrochloric
acid, the presence of which normally checks
the development of the microbial flora, so rich
within the stomach. The result is the production,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
within the organism, of all kinds of dangerous
toxins. The same thing happens when the liver
does not functionate normally, and this, affords us
a knowledge of the mechanism by which foods that
are most wholesome may become toxic by reason of
poor digestion or poor assimilation.</p>

<p>The absorption of spoiled viands may, <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>,
produce serious results. The alteration may be
due not only to a bacterial infection, as in tainted
meat, but it has also been proved that the flesh of
an animal that has died of terror or madness may
be very dangerous as a food, even after cooking,
because, although there are toxins which are
destroyed by a sufficient heat, there are ptomaines
and certain toxins that resist destruction under
these conditions.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The use of preserved but spoiled beef, preserved
ham or birds, sausages frequently, and pieces of
pork tainted by sausage poison, gives rise to a
succession of toxic symptoms the principal ones of
which are dryness, constriction of the pharynx,
bilious vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea with pulmonary
edema, etc. Fish and eggs are foods quite
frequently capable of developing serious results;
the same is the case with molluscs, mussels, oysters,
lobsters, and snails. Lastly, moldy bread, spoiled
cheese, putrid water, and spoiled vegetables them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>selves,
are proper agents for determining attacks of
botulic poisoning.</p>

<p>We have seen, at the beginning of this volume,
that putrid meats contain ptomaines, which are
among the most toxic alkaloidal bases. We have
shown that Brieger has isolated from them neuridine,
putrescine, muscarine, and guanidine; that Nencki
has isolated hydrocollidine; and that Gautier and
Etard have obtained from them parvoline&mdash;only to
mention a few of them.</p>

<p>Lastly, there may develop within the gastrointestinal
tract dangerous putrefactions, the products
of which may enter the veins and arteries from
the ileum (a portion of the small intestine) and be
distributed throughout the organism. Although
such poisonings occur, they do not immediately
follow the ingestion of the spoiled or toxic foods,
but they are always preceded by a period of incubation
varying from several hours to several days.</p>

<p>These alimentary poisonings are recognized by
a great physical depression, accompanied by vomiting
and paralysis of the lower extremities, sweats,
and diarrheas. In some cases there occur cutaneous
eruptions; and when death happens, this
occurs only several days later, and generally without
being preceded by any great pain.</p>

<p><b><a id="Urinary_Toxins"></a>Urinary Toxins.</b>&mdash;As we have already remarked
several times, it is by the renal way that the
organism voids its principal waste products.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>We have seen also that it is by the kidneys that the
toxins are eliminated in all pathological conditions.
As a general rule, the urines are always more or less
toxic. This toxicity of the urines must be attributed
in the first place to the crystallizable organic
principles (ptomaines and leucomaines<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>) which they
contain; secondly, to the non-crystallizable<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> extractive
matters not so well known; and lastly, to
the saline substances, among which the potassium
salts are the most active. We find these mineral
salts particularly abundant under normal conditions
in the urines of the herbivora. According
to Bouchard, 0.18 Gm. of potassium chloride are
sufficient to prove fatal to 1000 Gm. of living organism;
a man excretes on the average 2.5 Gm. of this
salt, and a rabbit excretes about double this quantity,
weight for weight.</p>

<p>A very large number of hypotheses have been
advanced regarding the toxicity of the urines.
Wilson considers the urea as being responsible for
it; Stadthagen<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> believes it to be due to the potassium
salts, etc. Bouchard<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> was the first to recognize
that the toxicity of the urines is due to a
number of causes. We will not dwell further on
these active principles which, in the last analysis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
are no other than those that form in the various
portions of the organism, and which are eliminated
by the urine.</p>

<p>It is self-evident, and it has already been shown,
that the toxicity of the urines varies greatly
according to the malady, in consequence of the
elimination of toxins by the urines. According
to Bouchard, in infectious maladies the urines
are twelve times more highly charged with toxins
than is blood serum. Moreover, the toxicity of
the urines is considerably augmented the moment
there is the least febrile condition, no matter what
the cause is.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p><a id="urinary_toxicity"></a>Even in the normal condition, the urinary toxicity
varies greatly; and this is easily conceived since the
physiological phenomena that control this secretion
undergo incessant rise and fall. Thus, for
example, the urines eliminated during sleep are
less active than those produced during waking,
because during sleep the elimination of cellular
poisons is at a minimum. Exercise, walking,
physical and intellectual labor, exert their portion
of influence on these oscillations of toxicity; and
this variation of toxicity is due not to any one
variation in the mineral extractive matters, but
rather more or less to the organic toxic products.
We will not dwell further on this subject, but will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
simply refer to the work by Charrin, already mentioned,
for all supplementary details.</p>

<p><b><a id="Autointoxication"></a>Autointoxications.</b><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>&mdash;The cells of the organism
having, as a whole, a life very much like that of
the microbes, it is quite natural that among the
excreted products of the living tissues there should
be found the same substances formed as a result
of the anaerobic fermentation of albuminoids.
Experiment has demonstrated that this is so,
and Armand Gautier has irrefutably proven the
existence of these principles.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Bouchard was the
first to demonstrate the toxic nature of muscle
extract,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and Roger<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> established the fact that
the toxicity of this extract is due to ferment-toxins;
it has since been recognized that after death these
toxins accumulate in the muscles.</p>

<p>The extract of kidney made rapidly by cold
process by triturating the washed kidney with
glycerin, and precipitating the glycerinic solution
with alcohol, contains toxic ferments to which the
name "<em>hystozymes</em>" has been given.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> These ferments
split up hippuric acid into benzoic acid and
glycocoll. Lépine has likewise discovered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
kidney a very toxic pyrogenic substance.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Roger
has given us evidence of the toxic properties of
the liver, washed and pulped, and then sterilized
by filtration through a porous diaphragm. This
scientist has shown that the toxic properties are
due to albuminoids, which lose their activity when
heated to 100°C.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>It must be remarked that the organs we have
studied are essentially reducers, and that the
more powerful reducers yield the most toxic extracts.
We find here a confirmation of Armand
Gautier's views regarding the anaerobic origin
of the toxic substances formed within the organism.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Blood serum precipitated by alcohol affords products
which possess very marked toxic power. It
would appear that the toxic products we speak of
here are thermogenic diastatic substances derived
from the white blood corpuscles. In certain diseases
the blood serum may acquire a high degree of
toxicity. We will recur again presently to this
property as a normal characteristic of the blood of
various animal species, and will study it in greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
detail in a future volume of this collection, devoted
to the immunizing active principles.</p>

<p><b><a id="Glandular_Secretions"></a>Glandular Secretions.</b>&mdash;On studying the venoms
we will see that a certain number of these products
are the result of glandular secretion. This is a
general property of the glands; and it was Brown-Sequard
who first drew attention to the rôle played
by these glands, and to the importance of the
products that they throw into the blood.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>P. Noel showed later that the testicular juice
possesses a high degree of activity, which he
attributed to an oxidizing ferment, and which we
have already mentioned, <em>spermine</em>.</p>

<p>The greater number of the other glands contain
proteid matters and various peptones, more or less
toxic, with amides and alkaloids.</p>

<p>Particular mention must be made of the thyroid
gland, the secretions of which exercise a powerful
action on the nervous centers and on nutrition.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
It appears reasonable to attribute to the secretions
of this gland a very powerful antitoxic action, and
the first proof of this fact is that the organisms
deprived of this gland become the seat of serious
derangements; the urines of such organisms become
particularly toxic, while, on the other hand, the
hypodermic injections of the aqueous extract of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the gland, when the derangements spoken of exist,
cause the immediate disappearance of the derangements
caused by the excision of the gland.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Attempts have been made to isolate the active
principle of the glands. Notkine isolated a <em>tyroproteid</em>,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
which is not sensibly toxic to animals
who still retain the gland, but which becomes toxic
when the gland is excised. It seems probable,
however, that this product is not the principal
agent of the thyroid gland.</p>

<p>From the researches of Schaeffer, Roos, and Sigmund
Fraenkel<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> it results that the active principle
of the gland is not a toxin, but a purely
chemical substance, a true leucomaine, which has
received the name <em>thyroantitoxin</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Baumann quite recently
extracted from the thyroid gland an iodized substance,
which he named <em>thyroiodine</em>.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>The <a id="suprarenal_capsules"></a>suprarenal capsules also possess properties
that have often attracted the attention of physiologists
during the last few years. They are considered
as being, just like the thyroid gland, producers
of antitoxins; they destroy, or seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
destroy, toxins that are artificially introduced into
the circulation.</p>

<p>Albanèse<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> maintains that the function of the
suprarenal capsules is to neutralize neurine, the
toxic product of the disassimilation of the nervous
system; this view, however, is opposed by Boinet<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
and Langlois.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> On the contrary, it has been definitely
proven that the suprarenal glands exert a
specific action on the poisons of muscular origin.
Abelous and Langlois<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> have in fact demonstrated
that the alcoholic extract of the muscle
of a decapsulated animal has the same properties
as the extract of tetanized muscle; the decapsulated
animal gives ergographic tracings analogous to those
afforded by tetanized animals. The removal of the
suprarenal capsule from an animal brings results,
hence, analogous to those of fatigue&mdash;that is to say,
that the toxic substances which accumulate as a
result of the decapsulation resemble those that
result from muscular exertion. The suprarenal
capsules exert their action furthermore on other
toxic products as well, as Guieysse<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> has shown,
and particularly on the exogenous poisons. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
conclusion, it may be said that the matter concerns
a most important rôle, and we cannot do better in
this respect than to refer the reader to the memoir
presented by Sergent and Bernard to the Académie
de Médecine in 1902 and entitled <cite>l'Insuffisance
Surrénale</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<small>THE MICROBIAL TOXINS</small>.</h3>


<p>There is but one way of characterizing the toxic
poisons secreted by microbes, and that is to apply
to them the name of the microbes generating them;
thus the soluble and toxic poison of the tetanus
bacilli has received the name <em>tetanus toxin</em>.</p>

<p>In toxic microbial cultures it is necessary to
distinguish the toxins proper from the toxic
alkaloids (ptomaines) which generally accompany
them; this is easily accomplished by evaporating
the solution in a vacuum at about 30°C., and
then treating with alcohol and ether, in which the
alkaloids are soluble, while the true toxins are
insoluble. By fractional precipitation with alcohol
it is easy to isolate the peptones and true toxins.</p>

<p>The microbial toxins possess two essential properties;
one the pyogenic property, thanks to
which the toxins first attract, then destroy the
white blood corpuscles or leucocytes, and transform
them into pus, and the other the pyretogenic
property, which appears to belong only quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
indirectly to the pyogenic substance. The toxins
in general retard the heart action.</p>

<p>We will not speak of the distinctions it has been
sought to establish between the substances which
possess these different properties, but will at once
take up the discussion of several of the microbial
toxins.</p>

<p><b><a id="Anthrax_Toxin"></a>Anthrax Toxin</b><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> (from Bacillus Anthracis).&mdash;We
will describe the preparation of this toxin as a
type.</p>

<p>The cultures of the bacillus are made in Liebig's
bouillon, to which has been added 0.1% of fibrin,
the whole being carefully sterilized for a long time
at 110° C. The cultures medium is inoculated with
a drop of blood taken from the heart or spleen of an
animal that has died of anthrax. At the end of a
week, the culture is filtered, and the filtrate acidulated
with a little acetic acid and precipitated by
adding powdered ammonium sulphate. The flocculent
precipitate is collected, washed, dissolved in
distilled water, and dialyzed. The dialyzed solution
is concentrated in vacuo at 40-45° C., and
precipitated by adding to it alcohol. The precipitate
formed is then collected and dried.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>In this manner there is obtained a grayish-white
substance which is soluble in water, and
which is fatal in large doses, but which, given in
repeated small doses, confers immunity against
anthrax.</p>

<p>According to Hankin, it seems that the toxic
property of this toxin is due to an albumose.</p>

<p>Marchoux<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> has been able to confer immunity
upon sheep by injecting first small quantities of
the filtered culture of the anthrax bacilli, and then
the virulent anthrax itself.</p>

<p>The animals thus rendered immune yield a serum
which may be used as a vaccin against anthrax,
and which even possesses curative properties under
certain conditions.</p>

<p>In every case the acquired immunity is only
temporary. We will recall to recollection the
method employed by Pasteur for vaccinating
against anthrax, using attenuated cultures, a
method which is practiced daily at the present time.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>From the cultures of symptomatic anthrax
(Bacillus Chauvæ) Chauvée extracted a very active
toxin which can withstand without impairment
a temperature of 110°C.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Roux<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> has shown that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the serum of animals that have succumbed to the
symptomatic anthrax is capable of vaccinating
against this disease; we have here a new proof
that the antitoxin is in fact a product of the defense
of the cells of the organism, and the author mentioned
has been able to vaccinate guinea-pigs by
injecting into the peritoneum culture bouillon
sterilized by heating to 115° C. or by filtering
through porcelain.</p>

<p><b><a id="Tubercular_Toxin"></a>Tubercular Toxin.</b>&mdash;The culture bouillons of
Koch's bacillus contain one or more active substances
which constitute, and which is at the
present designated as, tuberculin.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Koch's therapeutic
tuberculin is obtained by evaporating to
one-tenth its volume a culture bouillon of Koch's
tubercle bacilli prepared from a 4-per cent. glycerinic
mutton bouillon, and filtering through porcelain.
By fractional precipitation it is possible to
obtain from the crude tuberculin so prepared a
product which is considered as pure tuberculin, and
which possesses considerable activity.</p>

<p>Prolonged boiling on the water-bath completely
destroys the activity of this tuberculin, which
moreover hardly ever keeps longer than three
weeks. It has been found possible to preserve it
for an indefinite period, however, by adding to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
it 30 to 40 per cent. of glycerin. It possesses all
the general reactions of albuminoids.</p>

<p>Tuberculin is not toxic in the proper sense of
the word. Injected in small quantities into the
healthy human being<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and into healthy animals, it
exerts no effect; on the other hand, however, in
tubercular organisms, even in incipient stages of
the disease, even where it is almost impossible to
make a clinical diagnosis, the injection of very small
quantities develops a lively and characteristic
reaction.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>Grasset and Vedel consider the tuberculin as an
excellent means of diagnosing tuberculosis in man,
but in such a case it is necessary to operate with
the greatest caution, with very small quantities
of the tuberculin, and to feel, in some sort, the
sensitiveness of the patient, particularly in the
case of children.</p>

<p>It is chiefly for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in
cattle, however, that tuberculin is valuable.
Thanks to Nocard, the procedure has to-day become
a common practice. The injection of a fairly
large dose, 0.3 to 0.4 Gm., according to the size
of the animal, causes, in about ten hours or so,
if the animal is tuberculous, a strong febrile reac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>tion
with an elevation of temperature of 1.5 to
3° C., whereas if the animal is not tuberculous
no such reaction takes place.</p>

<p>Cases in which tuberculosis is far advanced, and
in which the organism is impregnated with tuberculin,
do not react after the injection of tuberculin.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Tuberculin does not confer immunity, and the
bacillus retains all its virulence, even in injected
tissues; nevertheless, the return to health of animals
in which injections have been recently made
may be due to the action of large doses of the
serum; and on the other hand the tuberculin, in
large quantities, may render the location unsuitable
for the development of the tubercle bacilli.</p>

<p><b><a id="Diphtheria_Toxin"></a>Diphtheria Toxin.</b>&mdash;The most characteristic property
of the diphtheria bacillus is the production, in
culture media, of a special toxic substance which
has been named <em>diphtheritic toxin</em>; this name,
however, has come to be also extended to a liquid
in which the bacilli have lived, and which has
been sterilized by filtration or by any other suitable
process.</p>

<p>Roux and Yersin<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> were the first to affirm that
diphtheria is an autointoxication caused by a very
active poison formed by the microbe in the restricted
locality where it develops. In order to obtain this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
toxin<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> a culture of the bacillus is first made in a
mutton bouillon made strongly alkaline with sodium
carbonate (10 grams per liter), and with the
addition of 2 per cent. of peptone. At the end
of about one month, the culture being kept at
about 37° C., the liquid is filtered through porcelain.
It is indispensable to employ a very virulent
bacillus; it is hence frequently advantageous
to increase the virulence and toxigenic power of
the bacilli it is desired to use.</p>

<p>The toxic liquid obtained is exceedingly powerful:
0.1 Cc. kills a rabbit in forty-eight hours.
This toxin is very sensitive to the effects of heat.
When heated to 65° C. it loses almost all its toxicity;
at 70º C. it becomes innocuous; and it only requires
to be heated to 100° C. for fifteen minutes
in order to lose all immediate activity even in large
doses. Nevertheless toxins thus weakened are
capable of proving fatal to an animal even after
five or six months.</p>

<p>Light, oxygen, ozone and all oxidizers destroy the
active principle of the diphtheria toxin, which is,
moreover, rendered almost inactive by organic acids.</p>

<p>This toxin is capable of diffusing through animal
membranes, a fact that is in agreement with the
toxic effect seen in a subject attacked with diph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>theria,
and due to the toxin passing through the
mucosa. In spite of this property, however, the
diphtheritic poison may be taken into the stomach
without any pernicious results.</p>

<p>Roux and Yersin have shown that, like all the
diastases, it may be precipitated from its solutions
by the development, within these, of certain precipitates,
particularly calcium phosphate. It is
precipitated from its solutions by alcohol, as has
been observed also in the case of diastatic solutions.
All the toxic substance is contained in the albuminous
precipitate thus obtained; but the prolonged
action of alcohol, or repeated successive precipitations,
alter it finally. Diphtheria toxin is likewise
precipitated by the reagents for albumoses, particularly
sodium sulphate in saturated solution.
This procedure has been utilized by Brieger and
Fraenkel for preparing the pure toxin, which
they obtained in the form of very light, brilliant
white, amorphous flocks, affording all the principal
reactions of the soluble albumoses (biuret, xanthoproteic,
Millon's), and which they characterized
as a toxalbumin.</p>

<p>On injecting into healthy animals this diphtheria
toxin attenuated by sufficiently heating at 70° C,
employing at first small doses, and gradually
increasing, it is possible to immunize them against
diphtheria, as was first demonstrated by Carl
Fraenkel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>Roux and Martin, who have specially studied
this procedure,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> have shown that a horse may be
easily immunized by injecting into the animal the
toxin diluted with a third of its volume of Gram's
iodine solution, and in successively increasing
doses. The initial dose is 0.25 Cc.; then, after
two days, 0.5 Cc. of the same toxin is injected,
and in like manner the dose is increased up to the
eighteenth day, when the pure toxin is injected,
at first in small doses, which are gradually increased
so that at the end of two or three months
injections of 80 Cc. of the pure toxin may be given
without danger; the animal is then completely
immunized.</p>

<p>The serum of an animal rendered immune in this
manner contains a diphtheria antitoxin which
possesses high power. A guinea-pig which has
received an injection of 0.01 Cc. of the antitoxin is
perfectly capable of withstanding a lethal dose of
0.5 Cc. of the toxin. The antidiphtheria serum
thus obtained, and in almost limitless quantities,
from an immunized animal, is capable of saturating
the therapeutic diphtheritic toxin, and has to-day
taken rank in therapeutics as the most efficacious
remedy in diphtheria. Injected in varying doses,
it confers a temporary but immediate immunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless antidiphtheria serum must not be
considered as an antidote; and in pathological
diphtheria, the more serum is required the later
it is used.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In certain cases, if employed too late,
it may prove ineffective.</p>

<p>The preventive action of the serum is remarkable.
In 10 000 inoculated cases Behring and Ehrlich
have had but 10 cases of diphtheria, and these
were, moreover, of a benign character. The duration
of the immunizing action appears to be from
three weeks to two months.</p>

<p>This diphtheria antitoxin was first prepared
by Guérin and Macé<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> by adding to the antidiphtheria
serum a large volume of alcohol, washing
the precipitate, and drying it in a vacuum.
It is soluble in water, and loses its activity when
heated to 65° C. Wassermann<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> has proposed
to extract it from the milk of immunized animals,
by first coagulating the milk by rennet in the
presence of sodium chloride, filtering, and removing
the fat from the clear liquid by means of chloroform.
After decanting, the clear solution obtained is
precipitated by adding to it 30 to 33 per cent. of
ammonium sulphate. The precipitate is dried in
a vacuum on a polished porcelain slab after having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
first been strongly expressed. It is then dissolved
in water.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p><b><a id="Tetanus_Toxin"></a>Tetanus Toxin.</b>&mdash;The fact that the tetanus
bacillus never penetrates to the interior of the
organism enabled us long ago to foretell that it
secretes a very powerful toxin capable of dialyzing
and diffusing through the economy. Kuno
Faber was the first to fully recognize the fact that
the culture bouillon of this bacillus, fully sterilized
by filtration through porcelain, possesses an
exceedingly high toxicity, and exerts a toxic
effect on 50 000 000 times its own weight of living
organism. Brieger had previously, however, extracted
three ptomaines from the cultures of the
bacillus&mdash;<em>tetanin</em>, <em>tetanotoxin</em>, and <em>spasmotoxin</em>.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
In order to obtain a highly active liquid, the same
culture medium is inoculated several times in
succession, but filtering each time before the new
inoculation; the microbes greatly increase in
number after each fresh inoculation, and the toxic
substance developed by them accumulates.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>Experiment has shown that the culture bouillon
thus obtained contains two kinds of toxic sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>stances<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>&mdash;highly
toxic alkaloidal bases (ptomaines,
tetanin, tetanotoxin, etc.), and a true toxin, possessing
diastatic properties, and of almost incredible
toxic power.</p>

<p>This toxin had already been isolated by Kitasato.
It is a toxalbumin, and is very sensitive to the
action of heat. A temperature of 65° C., maintained
for 30 minutes, renders it quite inactive;
and it becomes oxidized and is destroyed by the
action of the air in the presence of light.</p>

<p>Brieger and Boer,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> by precipitating with zinc
chloride the filtered culture bouillon, obtained
a pure, amorphous tetanus toxin, which they also
considered as a toxalbumin, and which possesses
exceedingly toxic properties.</p>

<p>If a precipitate be caused to form in these toxic
solutions, as, for instance, a precipitate of calcium
phosphate, this carries down with it all the
toxin present in the liquid. 0.0005 Gm. of this
precipitate is surely fatal to a guinea-pig.</p>

<p>Dozon and Cournemont have observed that
even in doses of 300 to 400 Gm. of the filtered culture
liquid, this toxin is not immediately toxic
to a horse, but kills the animal only after a period
of incubation of at least twenty-four hours. The
blood of such an animal, however, is immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
and directly fatal to animals into which it is
injected.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>Experiment has shown that animals that have
been cured of tetanus possess no immunity whatever
against tetanus; nevertheless Behring and
Kitasato<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> first, and Wassermann and Kitasato later
on, succeeded in preparing a <em>tetanus antitoxin</em>. To
obtain this, the immunization of the animal, horse
or cow, is effected by injecting increasing quantities
of the toxin, more or less attenuated by mixing
it with Gramm's iodine solution; the immunization
is easily and rapidly accomplished by the process
devised by Roux and Vaillard.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>The immunized animals yield a serum which,
mixed with tetanus cultures, renders these innocuous,
and which enjoys an antitoxic power that
borders on the marvelous.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> A quintillionth of a
cubic centimeter of the serum per gramme weight
of a live mouse suffices to protect the animal from
an otherwise fatal quantity of tetanus toxin.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>This serum is nevertheless powerless to preserve
man in cases of acute tetanus; it confers an immediate,
but only transitory, immunity.</p>

<p>As to its mode of action, it appears to cause
a permanent condition of excitation or of nutri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>tive
reaction of the cells, which makes these resistant
to the poison. As in the case of the other
toxins, the quantity of antitoxin necessary to
protect an organism is so much greater the later
the treatment is applied.</p>

<p><b><a id="Mallein"></a>Mallein (Toxin of Glanders).</b>&mdash;Among the soluble
products secreted in the culture media by the
glanders bacilli, there are found true toxins to
which are ascribed certain symptoms of glanders
infection. These toxins have been isolated and
designated by the name <em>mallein</em>. First prepared
by Helman and Kalmino, mallein was later on
specially studied by Roux and Nocard, and, in
consequence of the researches of the last-mentioned
scientist, it has acquired great importance.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
It is obtained by sterilizing at 110° C. cultures of
the glanders bacillus made with mutton bouillon
with the addition of salt, glycerin, and peptones.
To isolate the toxin the culture bouillon is first
sterilized by heating for half an hour in an autoclave
at 100° C. It is then filtered, concentrated
to one-tenth its volume on a water-bath, and filtered
through a Chardin filter. The mallein is
thus obtained in the form of a brown syrupy
liquid containing half its weight of glycerin.</p>

<p>This solution keeps well when kept from air,
light, and heat. In practice it is employed in 10-per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
cent. solution in phenolated water (5:1000). The
mallein may be precipitated from the crude solution
by the addition of alcohol, as recommended
by Foth. Foth's mallein occurs as a white, light
powder, very easily soluble in water.</p>

<p>Mallein enjoys a very important rôle in veterinary
therapeutics, a rôle analogous to that of
tuberculin, permitting the diagnosis of incipient
glanders.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>Experience has shown that in animals already
attacked by glanders, even if ever so slightly, the
thermic reaction never fails when 0.25 Cc. of the
mallein solution is injected. In healthy animals,
however, the injection of mallein, even in much
larger quantities, causes no apparent effect. In
animals attacked by glanders the reaction attains
its maximum in twelve hours, and several days
are required for the temperature to return to
normal.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>According to Nocard, mallein possesses no immunizing
properties whatever.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p><b><a id="Typhoid_Toxin"></a>Typhoid Toxin.</b>&mdash;This is obtained, like the other
microbial toxins, from a culture, prepared with
more or less difficulty, from Eberth's typhoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
bacillus. This toxin, injected into guinea-pigs,
develops in them typhoid fever.</p>

<p>In the solution there occurs a ptomaine, which
has been isolated by Brieger, and which gives rise
to almost all the phenomena of typhoid fever; this
ptomaine is called <em>typhotoxin</em>.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>The same author, in collaboration with Fraenkel,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
later on isolated a toxalbumin from the culture
bouillon of the typhoid bacillus. Sanarelli<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> obtained
an active toxin by macerating for several
days at 60° C. a month-old culture of the typhoid
bacillus made with a 2-per cent. glycerin-bouillon.
Chantemesse has also published a process which
yields a highly virulent toxin.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>Chantemesse and Widal<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> have shown that on
injecting into an organism increasing quantities
of the sterilized cultures of Eberth's Bacillus, it is
possible to fully immunize an animal against the
bacillus itself, and even also against the Bacillus
coli communis. The operation, however, is tedious
and painful. The serum of immunized animals
possesses preventive and curative properties respecting
the effects of typhoid bacilli.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>
<p>A dose of the filtered culture, which is fatal to
a guinea-pig, becomes innocuous when mixed with
0.5 Cc. of the serum of a vaccinated guinea-pig;
6 Cc. of the serum injected six hours after an
injection of the virulent culture, hence when this
is in full action, suffice to save the animal.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> So
far as the human being is concerned, the results
obtained have not been sufficiently satisfactory.</p>

<p>The culture bouillon of the Bacillus coli communis,
which is closely allied to Eberth's bacillus,
also contains soluble toxic substances which have
been named coli-bacillus toxin. This substance,
which is produced only in small quantity by the
microbe, is fatal only in very large doses.</p>

<p><b><a id="Cholera_Toxin"></a>Cholera Toxin.</b>&mdash;Very little is known regarding
the toxic products of the spirillium choleræ;
nevertheless, the fact that typical cholera exhibits
every symptom of the action of a toxic agent
demonstrates quite clearly the elaboration of some
toxic substance within the cultures of this microbe.</p>

<p>Villiers<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> found in it a liquid ptomaine; Klebs<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
found another and crystallizable ptomaine; while
Pitai discovered in it a toxin unalterable by heat,
and which he considered as a toxopeptone. According
to Gamaleia<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> there is present a true toxin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
alterable by heat, and the reactions of which
entitle it to be considered as a nucleo-albumin; he
has also found in it a toxic nuclein.</p>

<p>These toxic substances are found, according to
Gamaleia, Pfeiffer, and Sanarelli,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> confined during
the life of the microbe within its cellular envelope,
and does not diffuse through this. Metchnikoff
and Roux are of the contrary opinion,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> however,
and they have prepared a toxin almost insensitive
to a temperature of 100° C., and precipitable from
its solutions by ammonium sulphate or strong
alcohol; the toxin is a toxalbumin. This toxin is
quite toxic; one-third of a cubic centimeter suffices
to kill 100 Gm. of guinea-pig in 18 hours; with larger
doses, death is almost immediate.</p>

<p>By immunizing guinea-pigs, rabbits, and horses
with this cholera toxin, Metchnikoff and Roux
obtained a serum which is distinctly antitoxic for
rabbits. Nothing absolutely certain has been found
as to its action on man.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will not dwell longer here on the toxins of
microbial origin. It appears evident, however,
from what has been stated above, that the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
majority, if not all, of the virulent microbes manifest
their virulence by means of toxic secretions. Almost
every one of these toxins has been the subject of
study. They would otherwise not have interested
us here, where our main object was but to dwell
upon the general properties.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<small>THE VENOMS</small>.</h3>


<p><b><a id="General_Nature"></a>General Nature of Venoms.</b>&mdash;The venoms are
more or less toxic products secreted by certain
reptiles, batrachians, and fish; by a large number
of invertebrates; by arachnids, apids, scorpionids,
araneids, and a large number of other insects.</p>

<p>The venoms are toxic principles very closely
allied to the microbial toxins; like the latter, they
form two classes, the one alkaloidal, the other
proteid, possessing a true diastatic character.
They closely resemble the microbial toxins, moreover,
by the fact that they are capable of being
transformed into vaccins by attenuation of their
virulence, by the action of heat or chemical reagents,
and of leading to habituation of use and
the conference of immunity.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Moreover, like the
various viruses, the serum of immunized animals
is antivenomous, so that if injected into the veins
or beneath the skin of non-immunized animals, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
serum confers upon them an immunity against
venom which lasts for some time.</p>

<p>These venoms, like the microbial toxins, possess
but slight toxicity when absorbed via the stomach.
Fraser, utilizing a method previously advocated,
succeeded, by following this method, in vaccinating
against serpent-venom by causing the absorption
by animals of constantly increasing doses of venom.</p>

<p>It was thus possible to make the animals withstand
doses a thousand times greater than the
ordinary lethal dose; the blood and serums of
these animals at this point possessed immunizing
properties, and this property passed by heredity
to the offspring, to which it is transmitted by
the blood itself, and by the milk during feeding.</p>

<p>Along with these resemblances between the
venoms and toxins, attention must be called to a
very important difference. As we have already
seen, the action of the toxins on the organism is
always preceded by a certain period of incubation;
the action of the venoms, on the contrary, is almost
instantaneous, and in this respect they behave like
chemical agents and alkaloidal toxins.</p>

<p>If the venoms are preserved in a moist condition,
they change because they undergo putrefaction,
which is generally the case with all diastatic substances,
and particularly the toxins.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that animals which have
been bitten by a venomous serpent, but which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
for some reason or other, have not succumbed to
the venom, never recover their former condition;
if they were young, their functions cease to develop,
and they droop; if they are adults, their general
condition remains that of stupefaction.</p>

<p><b><a id="Venomous_Serpents"></a>Venomous Serpents.</b>&mdash;Among the venomous serpents,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
the most important as well as the most
dangerous are the following: Cobra di capello
(Naja tripudians, the hooded cobra) and its analogues,
the black Naja, Naja hagé, etc.; the elops
(coral serpent); the bungurus of Bengal and
Burmah; the Platycercus proteroglyphia, which is
found chiefly in the waters of the Indian Ocean;
the crotalian solenoglyphs of the two Americas,
and among which in particular are the rattlesnake,
the fer-de-lance (the yellow viper) of Martinique;
the surucucu of Guiana; and the moccasins and
copperheads of Texas and Florida. Lastly, the
entire group of viperian solenoglyphs, among
which are the Echidnæ, the bite of some of which,
for instance the daboia or echidna, is dreadful; the
African vipers, among which may be mentioned
the horned viper, the bite of which will kill a camel;
the springing viper of Congo, and the rhinoceros-viper
of Gabun; the European vipers, the most
dangerous of which is certainly the asp of France,
which is exceedingly numerous in certain regions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>
<p>The effects of the bites of venomous serpents on
man and animals are generally well known to the
public; it is well to recall them, nevertheless.
From the moment the bite has been inflicted, complete
symptoms of poisoning develop, attended by
a condition of extreme and increasing weakness,
with vomiting, hemorrhage, and decomposition of
the blood. There are, besides, particular effects
which vary with every venom.</p>

<p>The following table by Calmette<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> gives the
comparative toxicity of various venoms, taking as
the standard of comparison the quantity sufficient
to kill a rabbit in three or four hours:</p>

<p><b>Nature of <a id="Serpent-venoms"></a>Serpent-venoms.</b>&mdash;These venoms are
homogeneous liquids, somewhat more dense than
water, in which they are soluble, slightly colored
green or yellow, transparent, and insoluble in
alcohol; they contain from 30 to 35 per cent. of
solid matter. When fresh, they have a slightly
acid reaction. Towards chemical reagents, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
particularly acids, they behave like albuminoids;
almost all the combinations they afford with the
various albuminoid reagents are active, despite
their insolubility. According to Gautier, they are
decomposed by caustic potash.</p>

<p>According to numerous researches, oxidizers like
potassium permanganate, the hypochlorites, hydrogen
peroxide, and gold chloride (in 1% solution)
destroy the venoms; in certain cases when immediately
injected hypodermically in the poisoned
region, these substances are excellent antidotes
<i lang="la">in vivo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>We shall not here enter upon a detailed study
of the toxic albuminoid principles of serpent-venoms;
moreover, our knowledge is rather vague, as it is, on
a number of points. It will suffice us to know that,
taken altogether, the active albuminoids of these
venoms are numerous, and that each venom has
its own particular active constituents, differing
according to the species and variety of the snake.</p>

<p>Each one of these substances acts more or less
rapidly, and may be associated with different
principles which give rise to the variability of
the action of these toxic agents. Among these
toxic albuminoids, the most virulent appear to be
true albumins and globulins, followed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
nucleo-albumins, as we have already stated; there
are also found in venoms alkaloidal bases, but
these principles are present only in very slight
quantity. These bases are but very slightly toxic
compared with the toxins that accompany them.</p>

<p><b><a id="Natural_Immunity"></a>Natural Immunity towards Serpent-venoms.</b>&mdash;Certain
animals exhibit a natural immunity toward
snake-bites; among them are the snakes themselves,
the hog, the hedgehog, and the mongoos
(an Egyptian rat); the blood of these animals contains
apparently an antitoxin.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>Fontana<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> had remarked that snakes were quite
unaffected by the bite of the viper, even when
inoculated with the venom hypodermically. Physalix
and Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> confirmed these statements,
and showed that the snake perfectly resisted quantities
of viper-venom capable of killing at least
20 guinea-pigs. According to these scientists,
this natural immunity is due to the existence in
the blood of toxic principles analogous to those of
viper's venom&mdash;principles that exist in the labial
glands of the snake, and pass into the blood and
the fluids via the internal secretions. These writers,
and also Calmette, have shown that the blood of
venomous serpents becomes antitoxic when heated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>It has been known for a long time that the
hedgehog and the mongoos eat certain venomous
reptiles, and eagerly hunt for the vipers in particular.
When the hedgehog is bitten, which
happens quite often despite its dexterity, it resists
the viper-venom quite well. Physalix and Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
have experimentally demonstrated that the
hedgehog withstands a dose of viper-venom capable
of killing at least 40 guinea-pigs. Levin<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> has
shown that young individuals are less resistant,
and it is concluded from this, and perhaps incorrectly
so, that the immunity of the hedgehog is
naturally acquired, rather than inherent. Bertrand
and Physalix have nevertheless shown that on
heating the blood of the hedgehog to 88° C. it
manifests an antitoxic power toward serpent-venom
<i lang="la">in vitro</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Artificial_Immunity"></a>Artificial Immunity toward Serpent-venom.</b>&mdash;Immunity
may be conferred upon every individual
by utilizing the method of habituation. This
fact was simultaneously elicited by Calmette,
Bertrand, and Physalix. To effect the immunity
these scientists prepare an antivenomous serum
and inject it into animals, giving at first very small
quantities of the diluted venom, and gradually
increasing the doses, and the periods intervening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
between the injections. At the end of about two
months of this treatment, the immunity has reached
its maximum. Certain rabbits, thus slowly inoculated,
have been able to withstand 0.04 Gm.
of the venom of the naja at a single injection;
such rabbits then yield a vaccinal serum.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>At the Institut Pasteur at Lille there is prepared
in this manner an antivenomous serum from the
horse; it is capable of acting upon 20 000 times
its own weight. This has rendered great service
in the treatment of snake-bites, particularly in
hot countries, where the accidents are of daily
occurrence. <i lang="la">In vitro</i> it acts quite as well preventively
as therapeutically. It arrests the effects
of the naja, the horned ceraste, the trigonocephalus,
the rattlesnake, and of almost every one of the
venomous serpents known.</p>

<p>The relatively considerable immunity possessed
by certain snake-charmers, and which passes for a
magical gift, is due to nothing else but a natural
immunity, acquired perhaps by heredity, and
it always appears to follow as a result of a nonfatal
snake-bite.</p>

<p><b><a id="Venoms_of_Batrachians"></a>Venoms of Batrachians and Saurians.</b>&mdash;We
observe here a fundamental difference between
these poisons and those of snakes, as we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
see. These latter, in fact, appear to owe all their
toxicity to true toxins which they contain, while
the poisons of batrachians and saurians are chiefly
composed of alkaloidal bases.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>The poison of toads and frogs (studied by Faust,
Bertrand, and Physalix) is chiefly secreted by the
glands of the subcutaneous tissues of these animals;
it has but a very slight action on the unbroken
skin, but it rapidly inflames the nasal and buccal
conjunctival mucosa. The poison is a yellowish
liquid, milky and viscid, with a waxy odor and
an insupportably bitter taste. It is strongly acid
and caustic. When dried, the poison yields to
ether a fatty matter which, when absorbed by an
animal, plunges the latter into a coma that may
end in death.</p>

<p>The residue insoluble in ether contains the non-toxic
albuminoids, and ptomaines, such as methylcarbylamine,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
and isocyanacetic acid, resulting
from the decomposition of a lecithin that appears
to be soluble in ether.</p>

<p>To obtain this venom, Physalix and Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
skin the toads, first chloroformed, and dry the
skins in a vacuum over sulphuric acid; the skins
are then cleaned by treating with carbon disulphide
to remove fatty matters, and the toxic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
principles removed by means of 95-per cent. alcohol;
the poison so obtained, however, is impure. A
better procedure is to express the parotid glands
which have been placed in distilled water. Faust
found in this venom a principle which he named
<em>bufonin</em>. Physalix and Bertrand isolated from it
also a resinoid substance soluble in alcohol and in
a large excess of water; this substance, which they
named <em>bufotaline</em>, acts upon the heart. These
authors have also obtained another substance
which has a paralyzing action, and which they have
named <em>bufotenin</em>.</p>

<p>The poison of the common toad acts as a paralyzant
upon the heart and on the spinal marrow<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>;
that of the common frog possesses similar properties.
The poison of the tritons is quite analogous to that
of the toads; it contains a lecithin hydrolyzable
by water with the formation of alanin, formic acid,
and alpha-isocyanopropionic acid.</p>

<p>Zalnosky<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> isolated from the glands of the
skin of the salamander a white, thick, bitter and
alkaline liquid poison, containing a highly poisonous
alkaloid, <em>salamandrine</em>, or <em>samandarine</em>, which
acts on the brain, the medulla, and the spinal cord,
and which has the formula C<sub>54</sub>H<sub>60</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; it is a
strong base and yields crystallizable salts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>
<p><b><a id="Fish-poisons"></a>Fish-poisons.</b><a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>&mdash;Very little accurate knowledge
is extant regarding these. Many fish are poisonous,
and among them are the synanceia, found in
the Indian Ocean between the Netherland Isles and
New Caledonia; considerable numbers are found
in the neighborhood of the latter locality. These
fish are provided with spiny rays which are in direct
communication with a poisonous system having its
seat in the dorsal fin. The prick of one of the
spiny rays of this fish may under certain circumstances
result fatally, and in every case it causes a
rapid and painful gangrene.</p>

<p>From the reservoir the poison is conducted to
the sharp extremity of the spines by a deep channel
with which each spiny ray is provided; the animal
has 26 poison-sacs, two for each ray, and the sacs
burst when the corresponding sting is in any manner
compressed.</p>

<p>The poison is an odorless liquid having a slight
styptic or acidulous taste, and exhibiting a bluish
fluorescence; it rapidly becomes turbid.</p>

<p>The weevers, which are numerous on the shores
of the Mediterranean Sea, and which are also met
with in the northeastern portion of the Atlantic
Ocean, are likewise very dangerous, which explains
their popular names "viper-weever," "spider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>weever,"
etc. These fish are provided with a double
set of poisonous apparatus, the one opercular,
which is the more dangerous, and the other dorsal.
The opercular spine has a double channel in connection
with a conical cavity hollowed out in the
base of the opercular bone. The bottom of this
cavity is provided with special cells which secrete the
poison. The dorsal glands have a similar structure.</p>

<p>The poison of the weever is a liquid, limpid when
the fish is alive, and turbid when dead; it has
a slight bluish fluorescence, is neutral in reaction,
and is coagulated by acids and bases. It acts as a
paralyzant, its action being exerted on the medulla
and spinal cord; it retards the heart's action.</p>

<p>These examples will suffice; and we will not
dilate further on this subject, because, as already
stated, but little is accurately known regarding
the subject, and what is known may be summed
up as follows: Fish-poisons always give rise to an
intense pain, frequently with motor paralysis, followed
by paralysis of sensation; they affect the
heart, arresting it in diastole; and they are more
dangerous to fish and cold-blooded animals than
to mammifers.</p>

<p><b>Poisons of the <a id="Hymenoptera"></a>Hymenoptera.</b><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>&mdash;The poison system
of the bee, and of such insects as the wasps,
bumblebees, etc., is known to consist of a hollow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
sting consisting of two sharp needles communicating
with two poison-bearing glands, and forming a
flexible tube. One of these glands secretes an acid
liquid (formic acid); the other secretes an alkaline
fluid.</p>

<p>The action of the bee-poison is very often benign,
but there have been cases where death followed
the infliction of numerous stings.</p>

<p>Our information regarding the poison of the
cantharides and flies is very vague<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>; the same
is true of the poisons of various arachnids, acarides,
and myriapoda. So far as spiders are concerned,
it is known that their poison is an oily liquid having
an acid and bitter taste, and containing a toxalbumin
derived from the skin of the insect. The
bite of the ordinary spider occasions simply a
slight local pain, with redness; that of the large
poisonous spider, however, may kill the larger
animals, and even man.</p>

<p><b><a id="Poison_of_Scorpions"></a>Poison of Scorpions.</b><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>&mdash;This poison is a colorless,
acid liquid, having a higher specific gravity than
water, in which liquid it is soluble. The famed
legend of the suicide of scorpions is well known to
all. It is stated that when the insect finds itself
in a position where its death is inevitable, it stings
itself, and dies from the effects of its own poison.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
A simple method has even been described of bringing
this result about experimentally by surrounding
the insect with a circle of fire. Bounne, of
Madras,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> who has studied the procedure, has
demonstrated its entire falsity by showing, first
of all, that the insect dies from the effects of the
excessive heat, and further, that the poison of the
scorpion is harmless to individuals of the species
that furnish it.</p>

<p>Metchinkoff<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> has confirmed these facts, and
has moreover demonstrated that the blood of the
scorpion possesses an undoubted antitoxic power
against the poison of the insect.</p>

<p>The poison of the scorpion serves it to kill the
insects which are its prey. Frogs and birds stung
by the scorpion also generally die. A dose of
0.0005 Gm. kills a guinea-pig in less than one hour;
and according to Calmette<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> less than 0.0005 will
kill a white mouse in two hours. Oxidizers destroy
the toxicity of the poison. Guinea-pigs immunized
against the poison of the scorpion resist perfectly
very large doses of the poison.</p>

<p><b><a id="Poisonous_Blood"></a>Poisonous Blood and Serums.</b>&mdash;It is an almost
general fact that the blood and blood serum of
batrachians, eels, lampreys, snakes (even non-poisonous
ones), and hedgehogs are very poisonous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Mosso has found in the blood serum of the
lamprey a toxin possessing a strong hemolytic
power, and which he has named <em>ichthyotoxin</em>. O.5
Cc. of this serum injected into a dog kills it in
a few minutes. He also observed, in 1888, that
the blood of the eel, in like dose, kills a dog
almost immediately, and that the blood contains
an ichthyotoxin analogous to that of the
lamprey.</p>

<p>This substance, which appears to be closely
allied to the sero-albumin of the blood, has a
phosphorus-like, sharp, and burning taste. By digestion
it loses its toxicity, as well as by heating at
68° to 70° C. It is easily obtained by precipitating
with ammonium sulphate the serum of eels, and
dialyzing the precipitate dissolved in water. The
power of this substance is almost as great as that
of the cobra poison, 0.002 Gm. being instantly
fatal per kilo of dog.</p>

<p>The blood of snakes is likewise very toxic; the
same is true of the blood of the viper, as 0.02 Cc.
will kill a guinea-pig in two hours. All these
bloods lose their toxicity when heated above 70° C.
The serum of the hedgehog is peculiar in this
respect; when heated at 38° C. for fifteen minutes
it loses its toxicity, but it then possesses an immunizing
power against the poisons.</p>

<p>The subject possesses great interest, because it
was in studying these immunizing properties that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Camus and Gley,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and later on Kossel<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and
Tchistowitch,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> discovered the first anticytotoxin,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
which they obtained by treating the animals with
increasing quantities of the serum of eels. On
mixing the antitoxic serum of these animals <i lang="la">in
vitro</i> with the red blood-corpuscles of the species
furnishing the serum and of the hemolytic serum
of eels, it is found that the blood-corpuscles kept
quite well.</p>

<p>As to the blood of the hedgehog, we have already
seen that Physalix and Bertrand have shown that
it may be a counter-poison towards serpent-venom
under certain conditions. In its normal condition
it is highly toxic.</p>

<p><b><a id="Poisonous_Meats"></a>Poisonous Meats.</b>&mdash;It is particularly among the
fish that we find these normally present, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
a singular fact that, for a given species, the toxicity
frequently depends upon the period of the year.
Thus, at the period of spawning, certain fish may
be extremely poisonous, or, on the contrary, may
entirely cease to be so. The anchovy ballassa
from the shores of India occasions death even in
very small quantity; the poisonous meltite of the
same seas causes violent vomiting; the fugu of
the Japanese seas possesses an extreme poisonousness
at the spawning period, while, on the contrary,
it is perfectly innocuous at all other periods.</p>

<p>Numerous cases of poisoning have been chronicled
every year by the journals, due to the ingestion
of mussels; in the flesh of these crustaceæ is found
a dangerous toxin, <em>methylotoxin</em>. The flesh of
oysters is also unwholesome at the spawning period.</p>

<p>The toxic symptoms caused by these animals
become apparent in not less than twenty-four
hours after ingestion. The poisoning due to these
fresh meats must not, however, be confounded
with that caused by tainted or spoiled meats.</p>

hemolyzing diastatic substances which are found in certain
serums. It has been known for a long time that the serum
of the blood of many animals destroys the red blood-corpuscles
of other and different species. The chemical composition of
these cytases or alexins is not yet definitely known, but the
substances rank among the albuminoids; they are destroyed
by a temperature of 55° to 56° C., and act only in saline
solutions (Ehrlich and Morgenroth, <cite>Berlin. Klin. Woch.</cite>, pp.
6 and 481). The cytases or alexins, which will be studied
in another volume of this collection, and which will discuss
the active principles of the immunizing serums, constitute one
of the numerous soluble intraleucocytary ferments, and they
pass into the serous liquids of the organism only as the result
of a rupture of or injury to the phagocytes.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
